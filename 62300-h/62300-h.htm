<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="TRANSLATORS_FOREWORD" id="TRANSLATORS_FOREWORD"></a>TRANSLATOR’S FOREWORD.</h2>


<p>The Translator of Dr. Rosenbaum’s great book, the
<i>Geschichte der Lustseuche im Alterthume</i>, feels that no
apology is required for presenting a Work of this
calibre and importance in an English dress,—for
the first time. Needless to say the Book in no way
appeals,—or is meant to appeal,—to the general
reading public. It is a book for Students and Specialists,
as is recognized indeed by the conditions
of the present publication, in a limited edition and
at a high price.</p>

<p>To Historical Students and Medical Specialists
alike it is of the highest value and interest, and in
many respects an indispensable addition to their
Library. The object the Writer proposed to himself
was a History of Venereal Disease, to trace its
existence, symptoms and incidence, from the earliest
notices of its occurrence recorded in Literature
onwards. This ambitious programme he has only
partially carried out in the present Work, which
forms Part I. of the projected Treatise as a whole,
and deals with the Disease under its various forms
and successive manifestations throughout Antiquity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
In it he devotes his efforts to proving,—and we think
with conclusive success,—the existence, denied by
so many, of the dread Disease in different shapes in
Europe, Asia and Africa long before the Christian
era, and all through the period of Classical Antiquity,
scouting utterly, the popular theory of its first introduction
at the end of the Fifteenth and beginning
of the Sixteenth Centuries from America.</p>

<p>With this end in view the learned and laborious
Author collects an enormous <i>apparatus criticus</i> of
quotations from Greek and Latin writers, both in prose
and verse, and this not merely from the better known
authors of Antiquity, but equally from later and
much less familiar sources. Obscure Erotic Writers,
historical fragments, Christian Fathers,—all is fish
that comes to his comprehensive, though not undiscriminating,
net; and probably there is not to be found
in the whole range of Scholarship so wide and
complete a collection of historical and literary
illustrations and allusions brought together with the
express purpose of throwing light on one special
subject of enquiry.</p>

<p>Such in briefest outline is the scope and achievement
of Dr. Rosenbaum’s masterpiece. But brief as it
is, it suffices to show to how many classes of Students
and Scientists the work appeals. First and foremost
it is of direct service to Physicians in general and
Specialists in Venereal Disease in particular, to
Enquirers into the problems of Insanity and the
morbid manifestations of a diseased brain, as well
as to Anthropologists and all scientific observers of
Humanity. On another side, in virtue of its wealth
of curious and recondite quotation, it is of the highest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
interest and attraction to Classical Scholars and
every Student of Antiquity and Ancient Literature;
while midway between these two categories, Students
of Morals and Human Institutions cannot possibly
afford to neglect a storehouse of “human documents”
so invaluable in the domain of their studies.</p>

<p>Even to the general Historical Student, who
without laying any claim to the proud title of Specialist,
is deeply interested in the conditions of
human life on our planet in former days, and
eager to enquire into all matters relating to the
health and happiness of mankind, the Book has a
great deal to offer. Few things have more profoundly
modified these factors of human well-being than
Venereal disease and its ravages in all ages; while
any systematic enquiry into this most important
subject cannot fail to throw many side-lights,—lurid
enough, but none the less instructive,—on life and
morals, social relations and sexual aberrations, among
different Peoples and at different Epochs. What
can be more interesting,—painful as the interest
often is,—than much of the information here afforded,
at first hand and from authentic citations of Ancient
writers, of social and sexual habits and ideals, of
strange rites and rituals and abominable practices,
prevalent as well in the free Republics of Greece as
under the corrupt sway of the Roman Emperors.</p>

<p>Great and wonderful no doubt were the Communities
of the Ancient world, beautiful the fine flower of
graceful living, and high the level of philosophic
and literary culture attained, consummate the artistic
relics they have left us; but what a seamy side this
same Classical Civilization had to show,—what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
unspeakable abominations underlay its social life,
what atrocities of foulness, cruelty and lust,—some
of them flourishing under the sanction of Religion
itself,—counterbalanced the virtues of wise citizenship
and warlike valour and Stoic self-denial. Lurid and
terrible indeed are some of the pictures of horror
that shape themselves from certain of Dr. Rosenbaum’s
pages,—the whole Section, for instance, in
Vol. I. dealing with “Brothels and Courtesans”,
and in an even higher degree that on “Paederastia”
and the diseases consequent on this unnatural practice.
Specially graphic and vivid sections again, in Vol. II.,
are those treating of the practice of “Depilation”
among Greeks and Romans, and the Baths and
Bathing habits of Antiquity.</p>

<p>To return for a moment to the Medical and
Anthropological aspects of the Work. Perhaps no
single branch of Scientific Enquiry has made such
noteworthy strides of late years as Anthropology, and
in particular the special Department of that Science
devoted to morbid and anomalous manifestations of
the sexual appetite,—unnatural lusts, sensual aberrations,
sexual inversions, and all the rest. The
subject, no doubt, is repulsive, but it is none the
less profoundly important from the scientific side, in
connexion both with the general advance of our
knowledge of Mankind, and with the special Study
of Insanity and Madness, as well as from the
humanitarian point of view as giving material for
the eventual alleviation of many of these manifestations
of Mental Disease. Out of a host of
names, it is only necessary to mention two, those
of Lombroso and Krafft-Ebing, to demonstrate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
the high place these investigations have vindicated
for themselves among the scientific triumphs of the
Century that has just closed. On this side the
<i>Geschichte der Lustseuche</i> is of the highest importance,
supplying as it does innumerable instances of those
very phaenomena of morbid sexual perversions that
constitute the subject matter of this rapidly progressive
branch of Science, one likely in the near future to
prove of infinite benefit to afflicted humanity.</p>

<p>Of the Author personally there is no need to
say much, nor indeed is there much to be said.
His life was quiet and uneventful, as a Scholar’s
and Savant’s should be. After holding a Professorship
at Berlin, he was summoned to fill a similar post
at the University of Halle, where he succeeded to
the Chair left vacant by the death of the celebrated
Dr. Baumgarten-Crusius; and it was here that he
completed his great Work,—in spite of difficulties
and lack of books, which he naïvely and rather
pathetically laments in his Preface. Halle had already
been made illustrious by an earlier and even
more distinguished worker in the same field, the
famous Sprengel (died March 15, 1833), author
of a masterly <i>History of Medicine</i> and many other
professional works; and with a characteristic touch
of Teutonic sentimentality our Author dates the
Preface to his own <i>Geschichte</i> on Sprengel’s birth-day.</p>

<p>A by no means unimportant feature of Dr. Rosenbaum’s
book, and one according well with his patient
and laborious methods, is the very extensive and
valuable Bibliography, which will be found at the
end of the Work. This embraces almost everything
that has been written on the subject in all languages,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
and should prove of inestimable service to the serious
student.</p>

<p>For any errors that may have crept into his
version, the Translator must crave indulgence. Some
such are inevitable, more particularly in the renderings
of the innumerable Latin and Greek quotations, many
of which are involved in diction and obscure in
allusion, and some of disputed interpretation. The
labour involved has been no small one,—the mere
proof-reading itself being a heavy task in a book
like the present crammed with citations from several
languages.</p>

<p>For the general appearance and get up of the
Book, the Publisher, Mr. Charles Carrington, of
Paris, is responsible, and his name, so well known
in connection with the production of Medical and
Scientific works of this kind, is a sufficient guarantee
of excellence.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the Translator offers with confidence
the result of his labours to all Englishmen interested
as Specialists in the History of Medicine, in Anthropology
and the Scientific Study of Insanity, as also
in Classical Scholarship and the Study of Antiquity
and Ancient Literature, as well as to Enquirers
generally into the History of Morals and the life
and life conditions of earlier days. In doing so,
he feels sure of a favourable reception for so important
and scholarly a Work, throwing such a flood of light
on all these different departments of study.</p>

<small>FIRST (GERMAN) EDITION</small>.</h2>


<p>It is now six years ago, during my residence in
Berlin, and with a view to a historical Survey of
miliary fevers, that I began a closer and more systematic
study of the Epidemics of the XVth. and
XVIth. Centuries. In the course of these enquiries
my attention was inevitably directed to the subject
of Venereal disease, which exerted so powerful an
influence at that epoch both on the physical and
the moral life of nations. Accustomed as I was
to regard History as being something more than a
mere quasi-mechanical aggregation of facts, the
observation was soon borne in upon me that only
through a painstaking examination of the contemporary
conditions of epidemic disease could the
Venereal Disease of the period be really understood.
Consequently I felt I must isolate this terrible scourge
of humanity from the general survey,—so general
as to be well-nigh all-embracing,—and consider it
as a phænomenon apart.</p>

<p>Once started on these lines, I occupied myself
specially with the subject, and arrived at the surprising
result, that the Venereal Disease of the XVth.
Century owed its terrible characteristics solely and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
entirely to the contemporary exanthematic-typhoïdal
<i>Genius Epidemicus</i>, which made itself known in the
South of Europe by petechial fevers and by the
<i>Sudor Anglicus</i> (English Sweating-fever) in the North.
I concluded further that the disease was not epidemic
at all, merely liable to arise under epidemic influence;
and must consequently have been already
extant before the arrival of the said <i>Genius Epidemicus</i>.</p>

<p>Time and circumstances compelled me to remain
satisfied provisionally with this general conclusion,
and only after I had fixed my abode permanently
at Halle, could I resume my earlier investigations.
Yet again these were interrupted, partly by my
work on the Diseases of the Skin for the Dictionary
of Surgery edited by Prof. Blasius, partly by my
Habilitation (formal entry on the Staff) at the
University of that place, to which I had been repeatedly
invited after the unexpected death of the late
Dr. Baumgarten-Crusius. Eventually I was enabled
to devote the greater part of my leisure hours to
this subject, one which in the meantime was never
quite lost sight of. I began to sift and arrange the
material I found accumulated, but in a short time
I convinced myself that in its treatment I had to
strike out a different road from that followed hitherto,
if I ever intended on my own account to reach
important results; and I felt it would be impossible
to complete the whole Survey in a single moderate-sized
volume. Consequently I proceeded to limit
myself to the enquiry whether or no Venereal
disease had been extant in Ancient times, and it is
this investigation that I now publish as a first Part
of the History of Venereal disease.</p>

<p>The general plan I have followed in my treatment
of the subject is sufficiently explained in the
Introduction; while a perusal of the text will show
in what relation my investigations stand towards
those of my predecessors, and at the same time to
what extent these have been made use of, or indeed
could be made use of, in my work. Owing to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">xv</span>
very nature of the subject the Survey as a whole
was bound to assume a critical character, dealing as
it does not solely with the history of the Disease,
but also with the examination of an extensive array
of views and opinions already formulated. The
conduct of this examination I leave the reader to
judge of; but I believe I can confidently assert it
was always the matter, never the man, that I subjected
to critical treatment. Accordingly I laid little
stress on brilliant results, and made no effort to
conceal lack of facts by dazzling hypotheses; instead
I made it my supreme object to come at the truth
as near as possible, and preferred to confess my
ignorance, if the helps and authorities I had at my
disposal failed me, rather than advance propositions
the baselessness of which a sober criticism is only
too soon in a position to demonstrate.</p>

<p>“I imposed this law on myself—to believe no
man’s mere assertion; to depend on original
authorities; to look at every passage with my own
eyes, and read it in connexion with its context;
to pick out the plain fact observed from the Chaos
of hypotheses, and to accept as exact only what
I could deduce from the authorities myself and
see to be the evident purport of the observation,—absolutely
unconcerned how each arbitrary
theory might be affected or the sacrosanct authority
of such or such a Scholar stand or fall. Why
should we deem great men infallible? why find it
impossible to honour them and yet dissent from
them in opinion?—I felt I owed to my reader a
corresponding impartiality in statement of the facts
and arguments based upon them. If I was determined
to take nothing on trust, but to examine
and see for myself, I could not reasonably demand
faith from the reader and refuse to communicate
to him the proofs and original documents I had
drawn upon. It was no case of mere quotation
from books,—I was bound to lay open the original
evidence for his inspection.” These words of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>
Hensler’s I took as my guiding-principle, and if I
have deviated from their standard in the Third
Section, this only happened because the greater part
of the passages there quoted have been repeatedly
handled by my predecessors, and I feared to increase
the bulk and consequently the cost of the Book to
the prejudice of the reader.</p>

<p>I am well aware that the method I have adopted
hardly corresponds with the taste of the present day;
and if the public choose to find in my work nothing
but an idle display of quotations, I cannot fail to
be mortified. Nevertheless I prefer to encounter, if
needs be, the reproach of pedantry rather than that
of superficiality. With the difficulties I met with in
connection with particular investigations I need not
trouble the reader at greater length, as they are
sufficiently familiar to everyone engaged in similar
researches. I may be allowed to point out what a
task was presented by the co-ordination of so considerable
a number of scattered data. These I
had, in the almost total absence of earlier works on
the same subject, to collect mostly by my own
reading from very widely separated Authors; and
anything like symmetry of arrangement was made
still more difficult when, as occurred more than once,
the discovery of a single passage forced me to
entirely re-write a substantial part of my manuscript,
often within a short time of its going to Press. For
the same reason the indulgent reader must excuse
it, if here and there a later observation involves the
supplementing and in some degree correcting of a
previous statement,—a thing that would have been
done much more frequently, had I not dreaded
treating my material in too rambling a fashion. It
would be quite easy now to subjoin in the form of
appendices a multitude of additional proofs, of course
only corroborating views already laid down,—proofs
I owed to further reading of the Ancient authors.
However absolute completeness is impossible of
attainment for the individual; and I can only hope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">xvii</span>
the humble request I hereby express,—a request
addressed specially to professional students of Antiquity,—that
others may favour me with contributions
and remarks relevant to my subject, may be not
entirely without result. So later on perhaps the
material accumulated may be utilised more efficiently,
if the interest manifested by the learned in my
undertaking is of such a nature as to demand a
re-modelling of the whole Investigation.</p>

<p>The necessity I found myself under of expressing
this request for countenance on the part of students
of Antiquity is the very thing that specially induced me
to strongly recommend the First Part of my work,
even on its Title-page, to their particular consideration;
and it will be a source of self-congratulation
if the attempts incidentally introduced to gain a
better insight into the relics of Antiquity, meeting
with their approval, become an inducement to the
Physician in his professional studies to offer a helping
hand to human weaknesses. The question at
issue is nothing less than that of gaining a clear
insight into the nature and origin of the operation
of a Disease that destroys the very marrow of
Nations. Without such insight the Physician cannot
hope, whether in the particular case or speaking
generally, to obtain a radical cure; and of all forms
of Disease the Venereal is pre-eminently that where
obscurity in the history of the malady conditions
obscurity in its curative treatment. For the first
time it is successfully proved with irrefragable certainty
that the Ancients were infested with this
<i>morbus mundanus</i> (World-disease) just as much as
the Moderns. Honourable nations are freed from
the shameful reproach of fathering this Complaint;
and at the same time Physicians see themselves
forced to seek a reason for the untrustworthiness
they recognise at the present day as belonging to
the so-called “Specifics”, not in the nature of these
remedies, but in the changes which the Disease has
undergone under external influences. Moreover they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">xviii</span>
will find that the non-mercurial treatment nowadays
so highly extolled is far from being the mere
creature of fashion; rather it is the direct consequence
of the alteration in the common and universal
<i>genius</i> of the Complaint, which appears at this
moment to be again tending to a gradual disappearance.
The grounds for this assertion I have already
more than once explained to my hearers in my
repeated Lectures on Venereal Disease; and I
propose to communicate them fully in the Second
Part of my History of the Disease, framed on the
same principles as the First.</p>

<p>When I shall publish this Second Part, if ever,
will depend first on the reception of the preceding
volume; secondly on whether more favourable
external conditions provide the leisure that is indispensably
necessary for Historical investigations of the
sort, and at the same time put at my disposal a more
complete literary apparatus than has hitherto been
the case. For historico-medical studies in general
there exists hardly a more unfavourable<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> place than
Halle; and this is specially and peculiarly so with
regard to epidemic diseases. As far as Venereal
Disease is concerned the whole literary wealth of
our University Library amounts to something like
ten or twelve Works, half of which are all but
worthless. I myself shrank from no expense to
obtain possession of the literary helps required, and
my collections, particularly on the subject of Epidemics,
might boast of being not inferior to those of
any private individual; yet they are quite insufficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">xix</span>
for my purpose, so much, especially from the earlier
Centuries, being no longer procurable by way of
purchase.</p>

<p>But when all that is extant in writing is procured,
the business is still far from being done. I am still
in want of quite a formidable array of facts that
can only be the fruit of observations in more recent
times. For this reason may I appeal to my elder
professional brethren, and above all to the different
medical Unions and Associations at home and
abroad with the request that they will, whether
directly or indirectly, help me to the possession
of the facts in question. Such are in particular facts
concerning the influence of the <i>Genius Epidemicus</i>
on the different forms or Venereal Disease, and first
and foremost it behoves me to learn—<i>what influence
Typhus manifested during the first fifteen years of this
Century, particularly since 1811, in different Countries</i>.
That such an influence, and a disastrous one, <i>did</i>
take place is evidenced not only by the 364 pp. of
collected Authorities, but also by the data of the
brilliant <span class="smcap">Sachs</span> in his “Concise Dictionary of Practical
Therapeutics”, II. Pt. 1. (Article: Guajac) p.
637. To my sorrow I have only just, since the
appearance of the Index to that valuable Work,
become acquainted with these data, which appealed
to me all the more from the fact that throughout
they corroborate the results reached by myself in
the historical sphere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sachs</span>, and so far as I know he was the first
to express this opinion openly, holds as a fully
established conclusion that the Venereal Disease of
the XVth. Century owed the characteristics it then
possessed merely to the prevailing <i>Genius epidemicus
typhodes</i>; though at the same time I cannot favour
his assumption of a leprous-syphilitic Diathesis
(general condition of body) as already existent.
Nothing is better fitted to give a clear insight into
these earlier conditions than a knowledge of the
period of the Thirty Years’ War and of the Typhus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">xx</span>
epidemics at the beginning of the present Century.
Would it had happened to any of those heroes of
the healing art who played an active part in the
great Drama of that time to have crowned his day’s-work
by leaving us a more detailed medical recital
of the incidents. The number of men qualified for
the task grows daily fewer, the possibility of gathering
the material required daily harder of realization;
and, though it is not so yet, the work may later
on be impracticable<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>.</p>

<p>In conclusion—may I be allowed hereby to offer
my sincere thanks to all who in any way have
granted me active support in the course my enquiries.
I should be glad to give their names, did I not fear
they might dislike seeing themselves recorded in
connection with a History of Venereal Disease. In
spite of this scruple I feel compelled to make an
exception in the case of one of them, viz. my friend,
Dr. <span class="smcap">Eckstein</span>, Headmaster of the Royal High-School
(Pädagogium) of Halle. He shared with me the
exceedingly laborious duty of correcting the proofs;
and both myself and my readers into the bargain
owe him a debt of warmest gratitude for so doing.</p>

<h3>Conception and Contents of the History
of a Disease in general.</h3>


<p>If we would undertake to write the history of a
Disease, the very first thing needful is to frame in
one’s own mind a clear conception of what the
History of a Disease in a general way is, for it is
from a right preliminary conception, that the right
conditions will follow which a Historian as such is
bound to fulfil. Consult experience,—in other words
enquire what has been usually understood under the
name History of a Disease, and you find to be
included in the idea,—first, a more or less complete
chronological comparison of the different observations
and views of different Physicians at different times
on such or such a Disease, secondly, a survey of
the course of the Disease in the individual case.
The first is properly only a history of the opinions
of Physicians, the History of the Literature so to
speak of the Disease, which must come before the
<i>actual</i> History, while the latter is nothing else than
a history of a Disease in a single instance, that is
to say the history of a particular case of disease,
the history of individual patients; and this we have
long been in the habit of reckoning a part of
Clinics.</p>

<p>Nay, the <i>sum</i> of such clinical histories if taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvi">xxvi</span>
all together will not help us to the actual history of
a Disease, so long as they merely give an account
of the visible symptoms by which the disease makes
its presence known. By this means we shall be
learning merely the ideal course of the Malady,
getting a pictorial representation of it such as is
demanded by Pathological specialists,—as it were the
<i>internal</i> history of the Disease. We cannot write
the history of a single Man or of a single Nation
so as to be a sufficient basis for the understanding
and right appreciation of them, if we grasp only their
inner history, that of their <i>internal</i> development, and
consequently view them by themselves as a something
separated off from all surroundings, instead of bearing
in mind as we should the forms their relations take
to environment, to the outer world generally,—in
fact their <i>external</i> history. Similarly we are just as
little in a position to furnish the history of a <i>Disease</i>,
if we include in the matter of our enquiry only the
course of the disease and not its external relations
as well.</p>

<p>It is only the inner genetic co-ordination of the
two, viz. the internal and the external history (for
Disease has also an external history) that can conduct
to the <i>actual History</i> of the Disease. This may be
defined as <i>a genetic co-ordination and statement of
the symptoms of a Disease under different conditions
and in different individuals, from the first moment at
which they arose and came under observation down to
the time when the report is made</i>; or, expressed more
briefly, the History of a Disease is <i>a genetic co-ordination
and account of its development and progress
in time</i> (as conditioned by time). Supposing Time,
Relations, and Number of individuals definitely
limited, a Special History is the result; while the
General History of a Disease properly speaking can
<i>never</i> be viewed as isolated from its surroundings.
In that case the conditions on which the generation
and origin of the particular Disease depend would
necessarily cease entirely and for ever to exist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvii">xxvii</span></p>

<p>Now if we analyse the conception of the History
of a Disease into its component parts, we shall get
to know its special <i>contents</i>, the efficient factors of
which it is compounded, and which the Historian
has to comprehend and express. The function of
History is to exhibit something that has happened;
naturally therefore the first thing the Historian must
do is to look out for the point of time at which the
process of change began. But certain generating
factors and influences are indispensable to every
process of change, and their activity again is dependent
on certain favourable external conditions; and so it
becomes the next duty of the Historian to authenticate
the existence of the said favourable influences as
well as of the generating factors, and concurrently
to determine in what manner they came into active
operation. Inasmuch as it happens however sometimes
that the interposing or favouring as well as the
generative factors are known to be present, and yet
no outbreak of disease occurs, so far as we see, or
only an incompletely developed one, those influences
also will require authentication which hindered or
modified the potential activity of the factors.</p>

<p>Only after all this has been systematically and
sufficiently analyzed, will it become possible to trace
the development and course of the Disease itself
and to mark the successive changes offered to
observation from its first appearance to the time
when its history was recorded. Now these changes
are imposed upon it either by its own proper nature
or from outside, and so the Historian must explain
also the internal and external relations involved. Again
in any individual case the various manifestations or
signs of a Disease by no means appear all together
at one time, but rather develope in a series; so in the
<i>general</i> course of a Disease, as recorded historically,
a similar continuous series of symptoms will be more
or less clearly noticeable, yet without implying that
it is dependent solely on external conditions. Further,
as every Disease is liable at any given time to come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxviii">xxviii</span>
into conflict with another, the Historian will in this
case also have to point out, what forms the relations
of either took at the moment, whether the disease
in question showed itself as determining the other
or was itself determined by it, whether it consented
to enter into combinations, whether it led to the
annihilation of its adversary or was itself annihilated,
or whether lastly both remained in a manner neutral.
Finally account must be taken of the influence of
medical aid, and generally of the relation of the
Physician to the Disease.</p>

<p>These different points once successfully and in a
competent manner co-ordinated into a kind of organic
connexion, the resulting History of Disease, a clinical
History, yet as wide as humanity itself, will supply
the most momentous factor towards an insight into
the nature and essence of Disease. It will not
merely afford the theoretical enquirer the necessary
materials for his speculations as to Disease in general
and systems of treatment, but also teach the practical
Physician the conditions of a rational method of
Therapeutics; and will consequently be equally
interesting, and what is more, equally needful to
both. Such an organic connexion can only be
established on the condition that the Historian calls
to remembrance step by step, as he proceeds, the
sciences of Physiology and Pathology. Only by their
help is it possible always and everywhere to mark
the inner necessity of the relation of cause and
effect and to distinguish the essential from the
accidental.</p>


<h3>Possibility of the History of a Disease in
General and of Venereal Disease
in Particular.</h3>

<p>Having learned the Conception and proper Contents
of the History of a Disease, we naturally proceed to
another closely connected question,—do all Diseases
admit of such a historical exposition? It may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxix">xxix</span>
taken for granted at the outset with tolerable certainty
that the answer to this question will be
affirmative for the majority of actual Diseases; at any
rate hardly an objection can be alleged from the
theoretical stand-point. At the same time practical
Experience must be allowed a voice on this point.</p>

<p>Unhappily we gain but little that is comforting
from experience. It can scarcely be said that even
a beginning has been made so far towards writing
the History of a Disease in the indicated sense; and
besides this, diseases have been primarily selected
for consideration in which the historical factor
obtrudes itself, as it were, on the attention, to wit
the epidemic diseases. For the rest hardly anything
at all has been done, excepting only in the case of
Leprosy and the Venereal Disease, for which with
singular unanimity an epidemic character has always
been claimed. The Proteus-like character of these
Maladies hindered every attempt of speculation to
penetrate their nature, and so enquirers saw themselves
forced to consult History. But the merest
superficial glance at the treatment of Venereal disease
by its Historians (and this applies equally to Leprosy)
will show that little more than an insufficient collection
of materials towards an actual History of the
disease has thus far seen the light; and this in
spite of the fact that no contemptible number of
the most distinguished Scholars have devoted time
and trouble to the subject, in many cases making
it their life’s work.</p>

<p>However, if the matter is looked into more closely,
it will be evident that a large proportion of these
scholars directed their attention to one single point
only, viz. the antiquity and time of origin of the
Disease; and regarded all the other factors only in
so far as they supported one or other of the views
they had formulated. Besides the co-ordination of
these factors is seen to be so loose that no general
result of any stringency could ever be obtained. The
few men whose definite purpose it was to arrive at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxx">xxx</span>
such a result, failed, in view of the difficulty of
collecting the material, to reach the completeness
they had proposed, and so deferred working up
what they had accumulated till death put an end
to their enterprise. In especial this was the case
with <i>Hensler</i>, and the non-appearance of the Second
Part of his History of the Venereal Disease must
doubtless long continue to be mourned as an irreparable
loss.</p>

<p>The Past, on which all experience must draw,
affords us so little assistance here that it is to the
Future we must look for everything. The Present
cannot show us in existence any history of Venereal
disease as we understand it, but this in no way
entitles it to deny the possibility of such a History.
Thus it is of the highest importance to make the
attempt to arrange and sift the material now ready
and accessible, so far as it concerns the Venereal
Disease, on principles conformable to the Conception
and proper Contents as indicated above of the History
of a Disease, and for this a relative completeness of
the collected materials suffices. If in this way we
are successful in sketching the history of Venereal
Disease at any rate in its general outlines, it can
quite well be left to the continued efforts of other
Investigators to fill in the individual lines of the
picture, especially as then and then only is the
particular point ascertained by anticipation, at which
later accessions must be worked in.</p>

<p>In every History, what comes first and foremost
is to get to know the original Authorities from which
the material for its treatment can be drawn, and
this forms the proper Contents of the <i>Literary</i> history
of the Disease. Accordingly our first duty will be
to give a general survey of the literary helps lying
ready to hand for the use of the Historian of
Venereal Disease, and at the same time to specify
how far these were accessible to ourselves. Thus
the reader will be enabled at the very outset to
form a judgement as to the completeness of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxi">xxxi</span>
information supplied; and succeeding Enquirers will
learn the gaps that are left remaining for them to
fill up.</p>

<p>This will conclude a Survey of the historical
results so far obtained in connection with the antiquity
and time of origin of the Disease; and it
will then be possible to indicate the special Scheme
we propose to follow in our treatment of the task
before us.</p>


<h3>Abstract of Opinions advanced at various
Periods on the question of the
Antiquity and First Rise of
the Venereal Disease.</h3>

<p>The different Opinions advanced at various periods
on the question of the Antiquity and Origin of the
Venereal Disease may at the outset be brought under
two main divisions, according as the disease is supposed
to have been already known to the Ancients
and from their time onwards to have been continuously
observed, <i>or</i> on the other hand regarded as
having first arisen in the ninetieth year of the XVth.
Century. Both views were framed much about the
same time, and depended largely on the position
and education of the person delivering judgement.
The former may be styled the view of the learned,
the latter the popular view, though indeed at their
first inception it was not so much scientific reasons
in either case as men’s prejudices that formed their
basis.</p>

<p>The few really learned Physicians of the end of
XVth. Century and beginning of the XVIth. took
as the theme of their study not Nature but rather
the medical Writings of the Greeks and Arabians,
a field that had long been left unappropriated by
them, and all were far too firmly convinced, that
<i>Hippocrates</i>, and still more <i>Galen</i> and <i>Avicenna</i> had
already included in their Works everything that could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxii">xxxii</span>
ever be the subject of scientific treatment at any
given time.</p>

<p>Attention was concentrated upon the Skin Affection
that was the predominant form at first, and
this was naturally enough taken for a kind of
Leprosy, and called sometimes Elephantiasis (<i>Seb.
Aquilanus</i>, <i>Phil. Beroaldus</i>), sometimes “Formica”
(<i>Schellig</i>, <i>Cumanus</i>, <i>Gilinus</i>, <i>Leonicenus</i>, <i>Steber</i>), by
others “Saphat” (<i>J. Widmann</i>, <i>Nat. Montesaurus</i>,
<i>Jul. Tanus</i>, <i>Jo. de Fogueda</i>, <i>Sim. Pistor</i>). Hence the
view advanced subsequently by <i>Sydenham</i>, <i>Haller</i>,
<i>Plenk</i>, <i>Thierry</i>, <i>Haward</i>, and held for a time by
<i>Sprengel</i>, that the original form of the Venereal
Disease was the “Yaws” or “Piana”, and consequently
that Africa must be assigned as the original
home of the disease; and in this way the Moors
also were brought in as part of the concatenation.
Later on, when the conviction grew up that the
beginning of the Disease consists in local affections
of the genital organs, it was easy to show that these
had always been in existence from the most ancient
times. But as no direct information on the relation
between affections of the Genitals and Skin-disease
was to be found in the earlier Writers, enquirers
were driven to the supposition, that Syphilitic affections
of the Skin had been confounded by the
Ancients with Leprosy.</p>

<p>A view, which <i>Becket</i> first sought to establish on
precise grounds, appeared on the contrary too bold
to other investigators, who thought to find some way
of evading it. This was to the effect that Leprosy
under favourable conditions had changed into Venereal
Disease, and the increased rarity of the former
seemed to speak for this opinion. Supporters of
this last view are in especial <i>Sprengel</i> and <i>Choulant</i>
in his Preface to Fracastori’s “Syphilis”. Whilst
the particular home of the Disease was fixed in this
way by some authors, <i>Swediaur</i> and <i>Beckman</i> thought
to find it in the East Indies, and held that the
“Dschossam”, a familiar Indian disease, or else the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiii">xxxiii</span>
“Persian Fire” must be looked upon as the original
form of the Complaint. <i>Schaufus</i> agreed with them
in part; he believed Venereal disease to have been
brought by the Gypsies from India to Europe. <i>Dr.
Wizmann</i><a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> made the disease arise in the IInd.
Century in Dacia, which at that date was transformed
into a Roman Colony and had to welcome
the licentious Roman soldiery. The excesses of these
colonists, in a strange climate, and seconded by a
combination of conditions favourable to epidemic
sickness, produced the disease, which he says is
generated to this day in its genuine form in Turkey.
Accordingly <i>Wizmann</i>, as also <i>Sprengel</i> and <i>Choulant</i>,
and to some extent <i>Gruner</i>, who considered the
Moors to be the parents of the Venereal disease,
may be regarded as taking up an intermediate
position between the two extreme views, and as
making a sort of transition to the opinions of those
who look upon the Disease as a new one.</p>

<p>The special supporters of this view were, as
mentioned above, the non-medical, though a considerable
number of men calling themselves Physicians
agreed with them, though on other grounds, differing
only as to the mode in which the Disease arose.
The prevailing astrological views found the original
cause of the Disease in the Conjunction of the
Planets, a conjunction declared beforehand by
prophecy to bode disaster. With this were included
as contributing to the effect Inundations, the oppressed
condition of Nations, Famine and the like. The
disease was called an epidemic, or what at that
period was practically synonymous, a pestilential
disease, a Plague, and ascribed of course to the
wrath of God. There were other accounts given,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiv">xxxiv</span>
that still carry some show of probability; the Disease
was referred to the poisoning of wells and of wine
(Caesalpinus), to the admixture of gypsum with the
flour (Fallopia), or actually to indulgence in human
flesh.</p>

<p>When coition could no longer be denied as an
interposing factor, rumour resorted to all sorts of
wild tales, the copulation of a courtesan with a
Leper, copulation with animals, and particularly with
asses, and finally with the voluptuous Indian women
of America. From the latter story grew up by
degrees the theory of the American origin of Venereal
Disease, which found its chief supporters in <i>Astruc</i>
and <i>Girtanner</i>, and in spite of Hensler’s exertions
seems even yet not absolutely forgotten.</p>


<h3>General Scheme of Treatment.</h3>

<p>It now becomes important to consider more
closely these various views, as well as the reasons
advanced for them, and to subject them to examination.
But as the result of this examination will
cover to some extent the same ground as the formal
History, it will be expedient to treat the two as far
as possible in connection with one another. By this
method it will <i>ipso facto</i> appear how far the individual
views are tenable, and how far the grounds alleged
in their favour valid. And this is all the more
necessary for two reasons, first because by this means
a host of repetitions is avoided, secondly because
only in this way are such gaps as still remain clearly
recognised and made tangible.</p>

<p>All the different views fall, as already stated, into
two groups, according as they maintain the antiquity
or the modernness of the Venereal Disease. In
conformity with this division we must separate our
investigation from the outset into two parts, of which
Part I is to comprise the Venereal Disease in Antiquity,
Part II the Venereal Disease to the end of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxv">xxxv</span>
XVth. Century. To this will be added further as
a Third Part, the History of the Disease down to
our own day.</p>

<p>Each of the two earlier Parts will open, in accordance
with the views declared above, with a statement
and examination of the Authorities.</p>

<p>After that will follow an investigation of the
influences that evoked diseases as a consequence of
the use or misuse of the Genital organs and are
favourable to their genesis, as well as those influences
capable of staying, or in the case of diseases already
established, modifying their progress. The difficulty
of such an investigation is as striking as is its
necessity; for on this subject there is an almost
total lack of previous Works of any use to consult;
and yet it is only by their help we can possibly
win a deeper insight into the history of Venereal
Disease.</p>

<p>The attitude of medical Science in face of these
influences and their consequences will next claim
our attention, so far as it is competent to exert a
determining and modifying effect on the form and
character of the Disease. In this connection it is
especially important to determine whether the Physicians
correctly diagnosed these diseases for what they
are, or generally speaking had any opportunity of
doing so.</p>

<p>Having come to a clear understanding, as far as
is possible, on all these points, we shall then be in
a position to give a genetic exposition of the development
of the Disease itself. This will form the
conclusion of each separate part, as well as of the
whole Work; and then and then only we shall be
able to say our task is fulfilled.</p>

<p>In Antiquity we find that for a considerable length
of time the medical sciences were far from being
confined to a distinct profession, and further, where
this does seem to be the case, there is always a not
insignificant proportion of such knowledge that comes
to us merely as popular or traditional Medicine. It
is therefore evident, that if we would gain definite
information as to the existence of a Disease among
the Ancients, we ought by no means to confine our
attention to the medical writers. This becomes still
more necessary, if we are bound at the same time to try
and discover the ætiological relations of such a disease,
of which it can be stipulated at the outset that it is
intimately connected with the whole life and activity
of peoples. The Historian accordingly is absolutely
compelled to test and examine thoroughly everything
that can possibly enlighten him as to these relations,—to
interrogate the Literature of whole Nations.</p>

<p>But here comes in the drawback that only comparatively
speaking a very restricted proportion of
the Authors of Antiquity have come down to us,
even after due account has been taken of the possibility
that many an unknown author may lurk
concealed in some corner or other of the globe.
Then again the Authors that <i>have</i> been preserved
are almost without exception Greeks or Romans, so
that for the major part of the nations of Antiquity
the national authorities are all but entirely lacking,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
or else, where something of the sort does exist, it
is written in a language the correct interpretation of
which is still partially to seek. From all this it
clearly follows that a complete and final explanation
of any controverted matter of Ancient times can
never strictly speaking be expected, and in particular
that it would be a very rash conclusion to declare
positively that a Disease did not exist in Antiquity,
<i>because</i> in the extant and known books no mention
occurs of it.</p>

<p>But in as much as this general incompleteness of
information exists with regard to all relations of
Antiquity, and yet for many of them sufficient explanations
have already been obtained, it is obviously
incumbent on us to undertake for our subject also
the enquiry how far the extant authorities are capable
of throwing light on it,—a task that exceeds indeed
the powers of any individual, even should he be
able to bring to it all the qualifications indispensable
for the understanding of the said authorities. Consequently
there is no other course left open for him
but to institute at the outset a survey of what has
so far been accomplished and ascertained, and then
to bring into line with this whatever he has gleaned
from his own study of the authorities, in the hope
that another enquirer, like-minded and better equipped,
may follow on in the track of his endeavours,
and so by dint of united efforts the intended goal
may one day be reached.</p>

<p>It would be unprofitable for us, having laid claim,
as authorities for our special enquiry into the
ætiological relations, to the remains of Antiquity in
their entirety, to consider them in detail in this
place. At the same time it might well seem expedient
to specify more exactly such of them as are in a
position to afford us information as to the Disease
itself. These fall into two classes, viz. physicians
and laymen. The estimation of the first class as
authorities for the Venereal disease demands a number
of conditions which we shall only get to know in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
the course of our subsequent exposition of the
ætiological relations themselves, and will therefore
more conveniently find its place after this,—in that
part of the work where the question is discussed of
the influence of medical aid on the disease. Similarly
only a part of the lay authorities come in here,—authorities
from whom, as may be supposed, we have
only to expect rather fragmentary information, but
who are all the more important, when they do exist,
as by their evidence is proved men’s wide, in fact
universal, acquaintance with the disease; and they
cannot be charged with having made their observations
of it through such or such a pair of theoretical spectacles.</p>

<p>The more copious the materials the Historian
provides as to the ætiological relations, the more
scanty will be his contributions on the question of
the existence of the disease, as historical characters
of highest importance, or conspicuous frequency of
the disease, give him occasion to mention it.</p>

<p>The case is different, from the first with the <i>Poets</i>.
The <i>Satirists</i> and <i>writers of Comedy</i> it is true can
only supply hints, and these are often quite unintelligible
for later times, if Scholiasts and Commentators
had not taken on them the task of explanation,—though
again their statements must often be used
with caution, as they are so apt to impute to earlier
times the opinions of their own. But here also the
field of these hints is very circumscribed, as they
are only admissible so far as it is possible to extract
from the subject-matter a ridiculous, satirical <i>motif</i>
(<i>versus iocosi</i>, <i>carmina plena ioci</i>,—jesting verses, songs
full of jest, are demanded by the very personality
of Priapus); and even then acquaintance with the
fact alluded to in general terms is presupposed on
the part of hearer and reader. We see from this
how ill-considered is the contention of those who
say that poets like <i>Horace</i>, <i>Juvenal</i> or <i>Martial</i>, if
they had been acquainted with the injurious consequences
of sexual intercourse with Hetaerae, could
hardly have failed to allude to them on occasion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
in <i>unequivocal</i> terms. Hensler<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> excellently observed
long ago:—“In our Century certainly no German
poet says one word about it,—neither the dallying
light-o’-love versifiers nor the serious poets. But
from this to draw the conclusion,—<i>then</i> Venereal
disease did not exist among the people, <i>then</i> it has
never been seen in Germany this year, would make
physicians and barber-surgeons smile!”</p>

<p>Then again consider the widely different character
of the Peoples and their Languages. The flowery
Asiatic and Hindoo was, to begin with, far enough
removed from the spirit of Satire, and on all occasions
preferred to have recourse to images that to us may
well seem more than obscure. The Greek writers
of Iambi (Satiric verses in the Iambic metre) are all
but completely lost to us, while of the Comedians
we possess only <i>Aristophanes</i>, in the interpretation
of whom we are certainly not yet far enough advanced
to make all his allusions plain to us. Above all,
those who pronounce so dogmatically as to the
existence of the Disease on the evidence of hints,
appear to have hardly a notion of the condition in
which the Lexicography of both Greek and Latin
is,—a condition still in many respects deplorable.</p>

<p>Besides this the Greeks, and for a time to an almost
greater degree the Romans,<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> were above all things
reticent in speech. The Roman still preserved intact
through all the frivolity of his later days certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
shrines, that were never broken open until the
period of the utter corruption of morals; and then
no doubt afforded all the richer booty. But in Satire
it was not the fact that became matter of derision,
but the habits of the voluptuary merely <i>as affecting
morality</i>, as for instance is clearly seen from a perusal
of the passages of Juvenal<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> read in their mutual
connection. Moreover the following account will
sufficiently prove that even among the Romans affections
of thee genitals were never ascribed to <i>natural</i>,
only to <i>unnatural</i> coition, Paederastia and the like;
and that it was the vice that was derided, and not
properly speaking its consequences.</p>

<p>After the Satirists come the <i>Epigrammatic poets</i>,
near akin to them. Whether in this province the
Greeks will afford much material, later investigations
must decide; how abundantly the Roman <i>Martial</i>
has rewarded our repeated perusals, the reader will
soon be enabled to convince himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

<p>From the <i>Erotic poets</i> who composed their lays
under the inspiration of Aphrodité surrounded by
the Graces or of the roguish Eros, no one will
expect to gain anything towards our object. The
fact that the <i>lascivious</i> Erotic writers of Antiquity
have for the most part been lost can only be deplored
by the Historian of the Venereal disease; for undoubtedly
such works were in existence in considerable
profusion, only as in our own day they were
carefully kept concealed from the eyes of the
uninitiated. That the Greeks were not poor in
such-like productions Cynulcus teaches us, who says
to a Sophist<a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>: “Thou lyest in the tavern, not in
company with friends, but with harlots, hast a throng
of panders round thee, and carriest always with
thee the works of <i>Aristophanes</i>, <i>Apollodorus</i>, <i>Ammonius</i>,
<i>Antiphanes</i> and the Athenian <i>Gorgias</i>, <i>who
all of them have written of the Athenian Hetaerae</i>.
One may fitly call thee a <i>Pornograph</i>, like the
painters <i>Aristides</i>, <i>Pausanias</i> and <i>Nicophanes</i>.”
Writings of the same character were still extant in
<i>Martial’s</i><a id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> time, for the lascivious epigrams on the
walls of the grottos, temples and statues of Priapus<a id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
on garden-walls, and so forth, afforded an inexhaustible
mine for collecting amateurs, to whom we owe
the Priapeia that have come down to the present
day. Had they all been preserved to posterity, we
should doubtless have had no need to bewail the
lack of clear information as to the Venereal disease
among the Ancients.</p>

<p>Connected with the poems are the myths and
legends of Antiquity. These however being difficult
to understand when studied for their own sake owing
to the confusion that still reigns in all the interpretations
and discussions of them, hardly admit of
being used for our purpose with advantage.</p>

<p>Finally we have yet to mention the Fathers as
authorities for the history of the Venereal disease,
for their “Orationes contra Gentes” (Denunciations
of the Gentiles) especially afford much valuable
material towards a knowledge of the moral condition
of the nations of Antiquity. True it is very likely
these only too willingly allow exaggerations at the
cost of Paganism, and attribute to an earlier time
as already existing then, what really belongs to their
own day. Still these drawbacks lose much of their
importance in so far as the question for the present
is only,—whether previously to the end of the XVth.
Century the Venereal Disease existed or no.</p>

<p>The difficulties that arise in the systematic study
and manipulation of all these authorities require no
further discussion here, being sufficiently well known
to every investigator of Antiquity—be he physician
or layman.</p>

<h3>Influences which promoted the generation
of Disease consequent upon the Use
or Misuse of the Genital Organs.</h3>

<h4>§ 1.</h4>

<p>Directly it becomes a question of studying the
diseases of a particular part or organ, diseases
occasioned by the nature of the use made of that
particular part or organ, it is primarily requisite to
investigate more precisely the different forms of this
use. Then and then only shall we be in a position
to define the share which secondary influences are
competent to have in producing the said diseases.
The <i>natural</i> use of the genital organs is simply the
performance of the acts necessary to beget children.
On this depends the preservation of the whole species.
It is therefore improbable that Nature should have
made such use liable to produce disease. As a
matter of fact the experience of all ages shows that
in a judicious marriage, the natural aim and object
of which is the procreation of children, diseases of
the genitals seldom, if ever, arise.</p>

<p>There must then be a secondary use of the genital
organs, which is carried out without any view of
begetting offspring, or in which this plays only a
subordinate part, and consequently some other than
the <i>natural</i> object is that pursued. This object is
<i>Sensual gratification</i>, which is associated with the
use of the genital organs, and the use of the genital<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
organs for the attainment of this object is <i>Sensuality</i>.
Every misuse of any given organ cannot but be
associated with detriment both to the organ itself
and to the whole organism as well. This must of
course also be the case with the genitals,<a id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> and it
is in the misuse of them, in Sensual practices, that
the most prominent efficient cause of maladies of
these organs must be sought. Now it is our business
to give a history of the maladies of the genital
organs; and this is only possible on the condition
that we have first of all gained a clear insight into
the history of Sensuality.</p>

<p>Doubtless it is a melancholy task for the Historian
to follow up and reveal the moral degradation of
Peoples and Nations even to its most revolting
details, and the Ethical philosopher might find not
a few objections to raise against an undertaking of
the kind. None the less is the Physician compelled
to search out under all forms the traces of Vice
in its most secret hiding-places, and so fathom the
nature of the Disease in each individual case; and
still more with Nations as a whole is he permitted,—nay!
it is his bounden duty, to fix his eyes on their
doings and those of each of their component parts.
Thus only can he detect the nature of a Disease,
which destroys the marrow of Peoples more surely
and more terribly for this very reason that its genesis
proceeds in secret.</p>

<p>The reproach that the Moral repute of Nations
is hereby ruined, and the general mass saddled with
the guilt of vices which of course only individuals
ever committed, has no place here, for it is solely
through the precise knowledge of the doings of
these individuals that a due appreciation is possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
of the danger that threatens the whole body politic
from this source. Had not a false ideal of Morality
hitherto restrained the individual, as it did the
mass, from speaking out the truth, we should be
much farther advanced than we are in the knowledge
of a Disease, whose characteristic symptom it is
that those who suffer from it endeavour, as far as
they possibly can, to conceal its cause!</p>


<h3>The Cult of Venus<a id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>.</h3>

<h4>§ 2.</h4>

<p>The imaginative son of the South, already of his
very nature prone to attribute all that his unpractised
intellect failed to comprehend to the influence
of a special Deity, was bound to do this pre-eminently
in the case of an act that is even yet to us
moderns wrapped in impenetrable obscurity,—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
act of generation and conception. How could he
think of this Deity<a id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>, that used his own body as its
instrument and in so doing bestowed on him the
highest pleasure of the senses, otherwise than under
the shape of a Being equally alluring and loving,
convinced that this Being must be infinitely more
alluring<a id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> than even the beloved form that he held
in his arms? “The young man’s fancy” craves a
lovely maiden; the maiden needed a loving sister,
into whose arms she could trustingly throw herself,
who intuitively divined all her soft, sweet emotions,
to express which she sought in vain for words, which
she scarce dared to own to herself that she was
conscious of, and understood them!</p>

<p>To the Goddess’ Temple she wandered, before
her poured out the longings that filled her heart to
overflowing<a id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>, and at the last offered up herself a
gift at the holy place, that so Aphrodité Ἀφροδίτη
εὔκαρπος, κουροτρόφος, γενετύλλις,—Aphrodité
rich in fruit, giving offspring, of the birth-hour) might
be glorified in her, and herself be a participant in
the highest happiness of Woman,—the joys of Motherhood.
First she prepared herself by bodily purifica<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>tion<a id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>
before she trod the Temple threshold, then at
the Temple altar she received spiritual purity; and
thus thrilled through and through with the influence
of the holiest, the Priest’s hand<a id="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> led her to the
arms of her Lover, who as unspoiled yet and unsophisticated
as she, had not sought to unveil the
most august secrets of Nature with audacious hand.
Intoxicated with rapture he drew his darling on to
the Torus (sacred couch) bedecked with fragrant
blossoms, and almost unconsciously to himself, became
the creator of a being wherein both saw themselves
made young again.</p>

<p>If Man is really the noblest of created Beings,
made by the Creator in his own image, in very
truth then the power that unconsciously raises Man
to the level of his Maker must be a divine power
too, and that act in the exercise of which it comes
itself into play an act of most sublime worship.
Are we to suppose there never was a time when
Man, pure as he came from the hand of his Creator,
followed in the singleness of his heart no other law<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
but that written in his heart? Surely not merely
in the dreams of the Poet was found the legend of
an Eden, from which Man was driven out by his
own guilt; more true to say that to this day we are
all of us born therein. But alas! others’ guilt or
our own tears us away from out the garden of
Paradise, ere we have yet been able often to raise
our eyes to take delight in its glory. Thus it is
that many a man now and again has the memory
of a Dream, that accompanies him on his pilgrimage
through life, and he hopes to find in the future
what long ago, before he grew conscious of its
existence, became a thing of the past. Perchance
it may be the fatal tasting of the fruit of the Tree
of Knowledge was nothing else than the misuse
of the genital organs, to content bestial longings, to
arouse the titillation of an enervating pruriency<a id="FNanchor_17_17" href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
“And the eyes of them both were opened, and they
knew that they were naked!” The bestial had won
the victory over the divine, which fled away from
the desecrated altar; and the Genius of Mankind
wept over their Fall!</p>

<p>Here is the History at once of Man individually
and of whole Peoples. Over the Temple-worship
of Aphrodité also impended such a crisis; and sooner
or later the holy courts of Venus Urania (Heavenly
Venus) changed into the Lupanar of Venus Vulgivaga
(Brothel of Venus of the Streets).</p>


<h4>§ 3.</h4>

<p>A precise knowledge of the extension of the Venus-cult
in chronological order would readily supply us
the means of following up historically the moral
deterioration of the Peoples of Antiquity; but so
long as we do not possess this, History cannot be
expected to give us anything of great value. All
that we are for the present in a position to give,
pertinent to the object we aim at, is as follows:</p>

<p>“The worship of this Urania,” says Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_18_18" href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
“the Assyrians first introduced amongst themselves,
after the Assyrians the Paphians in Cyprus<a id="FNanchor_19_19" href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>, and
among the Phoenicians<a id="FNanchor_20_20" href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> the inhabitants of Ascalon
in Palestine. From the Phoenicians the inhabitants
of Cythera<a id="FNanchor_21_21" href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> learned to know and worship her.
At Athene Aegeus introduced her worship.” It was
at Babylon then that the cult of Venus originated
as <i>Mylitta</i> worship, spread over the inland
parts to Mesopotamia as the Sabaean<a id="FNanchor_22_22" href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> religion,
and was passed on by the Phoenicians to the seaboard
peoples as Astarté-worship. For at the spot
where this cult first arose, it lasted longest in its
original purity, and <i>Herodotus</i><a id="FNanchor_23_23" href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> could report how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
at Babylon the daughters of the country were compelled
<i>once</i> in their life-time to give themselves for
money to a strange man to win the favour of the
goddess, then to return to their dwelling all the
more virtuous for the sin, and neither promises nor
gifts, however great these might be, availed ever
again to draw them into the arms of a stranger.
Later indeed it was different even here, perhaps
through the influence of the Phoenicians, who had
manifold dealings with them. For <i>Herodotus</i> himself
relates elsewhere (Bk. I. 196), that after the capture
of Babylon by the Persians, the poorer classes,
dreading the forcible abduction of their daughters,
if means of subsistence failed them, made them
harbour-wenches<a id="FNanchor_24_24" href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>. And accordingly <i>Q. Curtius</i><a id="FNanchor_25_25" href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>
felt bound to write of Babylon:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

<p>“Nihil urbis eius corruptius moribus, nihil ad irritandas
illiciendasque immodicas voluptates instructius.
Liberos coniugesque cum hospitibus stupro
coire, modo pretium flagitii detur, parentes maritique
patiuntur.... Feminarum convivia ineuntium in
principio modestus est habitus, dein summa quaeque
amicula exuunt, paulatimque pudorem profanant: ad
ultimum ... ima corporum velamenta proiiciunt; nec
meretricum hoc dedecus est sed matronarum virginumque
apud quas comitas habetur vulgati corporis
vilitas.”</p>

<p>(Nothing can well be more corrupt than the
manners of this City, nothing more artfully adapted
to excite the passions and allure to voluptuous excesses.
Strangers are permitted by parents and
husbands, provided the price of shame is forthcoming,
to have lustful intercourse with their children
and their wives.... At their first entrance to the
banquet-room the women’s dress is modest, presently
they remove their outer robes one by one, and little by
little violate all modesty, ... at the last stripping off the
innermost coverings of their persons. And this is no mere
abomination of harlots, but the habit of matrons and
maids, who consider that in thus making themselves
cheap and exposing their bodies they are showing
courtesy). This custom we find again carried still
further amongst the Armenians, who <i>Strabo</i><a id="FNanchor_26_26" href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a><a id="FNanchor_27_27" href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> says
consecrate their daughters for some considerable
length of time to Anaitis, and only after this suffer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
them to marry. <i>Herodotus</i><a id="FNanchor_28_28" href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> relates the same custom
of the Lydians, degenerated in the same way as had
been the case in later times at Babylon, for here
too the lower classes used to abandon their daughters
to prostitution for a livelihood. Still in its original
purity the usage reached the Phoenicians<a id="FNanchor_29_29" href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>, but
with them also would seem to have early degenerated,
although in particular towns of Phoenicia the
practice appears to have been followed only under
certain circumstances. <i>Lucian</i><a id="FNanchor_30_30" href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> relates that the
women, of Byblus, where was a Temple of Ἀφροδίτη
βυβλίη (Venus of Byblos), if they would not allow
their hair to be cut off at the Funeral-feast of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
Adonis, were bound in honour of Venus for one
whole day to abandon their bodies to strangers.
Among the Carthaginians<a id="FNanchor_31_31" href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> also, as in Cyprus<a id="FNanchor_32_32" href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>,
maidens had to earn their dowry, and the Tyrant
Dionysius introduced the same custom, no doubt
with a secondary design of a profit for himself,
amongst the people of Locri.<a id="FNanchor_33_33" href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>


<h4>§ 4.</h4>

<p>As to the <i>reason</i> for this custom, one might be
found in the opinion that prevailed almost universally
in Antiquity amongst the Asiatic peoples, that the
first-fruits of everything were consecrate to the Deity,
and accordingly the virgin’s hymen must be offered
up to Venus. But this will not in any way explain
why the self-surrender must nearly always take place
with a <i>Stranger</i> (ἀνδρὶ ξείνῳ) of all people in the
world. <i>Heyne</i><a id="FNanchor_34_34" href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> and <i>Fr. Jacobs</i><a id="FNanchor_35_35" href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>, who paid special
attention to this custom, are it is true agreed in
thinking that a religious motive lay at the bottom
of it, though they differ in their conception of what
it was; but neither of them hit on the right explanation.
A careful distinction must be made between
the <i>Ceremony</i> and the <i>Act</i> of the self-surrender. The
first was a matter of religion, the second not; for
the women were conveyed at Babylon outside the
Temple-precincts, in Cyprus to the sea-shore, for
the purpose of yielding their bodies to strangers<a id="FNanchor_36_36" href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
Had the act been regarded at that period as a
religious one, it would of necessity have been practised,
as was the case before and again later, in the Temple
or at least within its precincts, and of course with
fellow-countrymen, strangers not being allowed to
take part in any native religious practice.</p>

<p>The discrepancies however soon disappear if it is remembered that
in Antiquity, as to this day amongst many savage peoples, not only was
the menstrual blood (of which more fully later) held to be impure,
but also the blood that flowed, when a virgin was deflowered, from
the rupture of the hymen, and consequently the act of defloration as
well. The same held good in the case of coition with widows, because
it was believed that with them the menstrual blood accumulated in
greater quantity, then was discharged on occasion of the first coition,
and must necessarily cause injury to the man. This also explains why
<i>Herodotus</i> (loco citato) says γυναῖκες (women) and not simply κόραι
or παρθένοι (girls, virgins); and removes at once <i>Heyne’s</i> doubts
(p. 32) and the difficulties raised by <i>Heeren</i><a id="FNanchor_37_37"
href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>.</p>

<p>The dwellers on the sea-coast, who enjoyed more
active intercourse with the rest of the world, left to
strangers the polluting act of defloration, whilst among
inland peoples this office was undertaken for those
of the higher classes<a id="FNanchor_38_38" href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> by the priests, or else an
idol, specially appropriated for the purpose, a Priapus
or Lingam (see later) was employed. Subsequently
several mistaken reasons may well have been alleged
for the custom; the only idea that continued to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
consistently held was that defloration was not a
proper function of the bridegroom. It was rather
made a matter of honour, and accordingly brides
offered themselves first to the wedding-guests, as
among the Nasomonians in Africa<a id="FNanchor_39_39" href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> and in the
Balearic Islands<a id="FNanchor_40_40" href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>, where the right of preference went
by age.</p>

<p>We must then take into consideration <i>several</i> causal
factors to help us to an explanation of the custom
in question. The original motive may very well
have been in every case the consecration of the
maiden’s virginity to the goddess,<a id="FNanchor_41_41" href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>—Hieroduli
(Temple hand-maids) in the earlier meaning. Further
again the maiden was bound to pay her tribute to
the goddess of sexual Pleasure<a id="FNanchor_42_42" href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>, so as to co-operate
with the husband with a view to the procreation of
children. Little by little the custom lost its purer
character. After a time it ceased to be any longer
one of universal obligation, and became binding only
for the poorer classes, who found in it an opportunity
of earning a dowry<a id="FNanchor_43_43" href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> for their daughters.
Meantime the rich adopted the habit of presenting
female slaves to the temple of the goddess, thereby
giving occasion for the establishment of the regular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
Hieroduli,—who subsequently grew into <i>filles de joie</i>
in the proper sense, and laying the foundation of
the brothel system (see later). Out of the idea of
consecration was subsequently developed on the one
hand that of initiation for the married state,—an
idea found again in the “proof-nights” custom of
the Middle Ages, and on the other the idea of
bondage that grew into the “Jus primae noctis”
(Right of first night).</p>

<p>As second factor then must be reckoned the belief
in the harmfulness of the blood resulting from rupture
of the hymen at defloration; and connected with
this the actual injury that the man’s genital organs
are occasionally exposed to in deflowering a maid
with narrow vaginal orifice, or at any rate the effort
necessarily called for to perforate the hymen, a
motive not without actual weight amongst indolent
Asiatics<a id="FNanchor_44_44" href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>. To this day the bridegroom at Goa gives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
thanks to the <i>Priapus</i> (Lingam), that has loosed his
bride’s virgin-zone, with marks of the deepest adoration
and gratitude for having performed this honourable
service and so relieved him of a heavy task<a id="FNanchor_45_45" href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>.</p>

<p>For the maid defloration is yet more painful, and
as she had to go through it once and once only
with a stranger, she might readily get the idea that
it was the stranger alone that was to blame; consequently
that every surrender to a stranger must
involve the same sufferings. This would deter her
from a second experience of the kind, and all the
more so because the subsequent embraces of the
husband stirred in her only pleasurable sensations.
So the wife had no inducement to break the marriage
vow.</p>


<h4>§ 5.</h4>

<p>When and under what circumstances the cult of
Venus first came into <i>Greece</i> can hardly be discovered,
though indeed <i>Pausanias</i> states in the passage quoted
above that it was Aegeus (Erechtheus) who brought
it to Athens. For a long period it played only a
subordinate part, being kept under by the primeval
god Eros (Love)<a id="FNanchor_46_46" href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>. No doubt the physical element
may have come in early times from abroad<a id="FNanchor_47_47" href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>, but
before long the stamp of the spiritual was strongly
impressed upon it (the Graces were added as handmaidens
to Aphrodité!),—so strongly that the idea
of the procreating power fell henceforth into the
background, to give place to that of Love, an idea
that was entirely foreign to Asia. The amalgamation
of Eros and Aphrodité, who was now first hallowed
by him, or as the poet puts it, now first brought
forward into the assemblage (Order) of the Gods,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
came about so gradually and imperceptibly that it
would hardly be possible to obtain a clear conception
of the views of the Greeks on the point. In
consequence of the growing intercourse with the
peoples of Asia, and particularly the Phoenicians<a id="FNanchor_48_48" href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>,
foreign customs and usages came to be introduced
and adopted with ever increasing frequency; and
during the flourishing period of Greece we see the
Asiatic character of the Venus ritual come into ever
greater prominence, and the goddess herself in a sense
re-introduced. Especially was this the case in the
Islands and the seaport-towns, where as a rule the
worship of Aphrodité first arose. Hence she was
entitled the goddess “born of the (Sea) Foam”,
and temples were built to her as “Protectress of
Havens.”<a id="FNanchor_49_49" href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>But the Greek genius found this physical Cult too
strongly opposed to its own spirit. The Greek
could not bring it into unison with his Eros-worship;
and accordingly distinguished his goddess, under the
name of Aphrodité Urania (Heavenly Aphrodité)<a id="FNanchor_50_50" href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>,
from that worshipped by other Peoples as Aphrodité<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
Pandemos<a id="FNanchor_51_51" href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> (Aphrodité Common to all Men). The
latter was relegated to the Islands<a id="FNanchor_52_52" href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>, and particularly
Cyprus; and never properly speaking became a
national Deity.</p>

<p>It is very interesting as a general fact that the
Venus Urania always belongs, so it appears, to the
inland regions, the Venus Pandemos on the contrary
to the sea-ports and islands<a id="FNanchor_53_53" href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>; for it was as a rule
from East to West along the coast-lines that the
Asiatic form of the Cult spread, a thing that could
not have happened except through the instrumentality
of a people early practising navigation, such as the
Phoenicians.</p>

<p>It cannot fail to have an important bearing on
our subject to make a more precise acquaintance
with the geographical distribution of the Venus-cult.
We propose to give here a brief enumeration of the
localities where she had her temples. The passages
in evidence for this will be found given with
tolerable completeness in <i>Manso</i>,—p. 46, also pp.
158 sqq.</p>

<p>In <i>Cyprus</i>: at Paphos, whither came yearly a
great concourse of people at the festival time<a id="FNanchor_54_54" href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>; in
<i>Pamphilia</i>; <i>in Asia Minor</i>; along the <i>Coast-line of
the Aegean</i>; in Caria (Cnidos); Halicarnassus; Miletus;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
Ephesus; Sardis; Pergamus; Pyrrha; Abydos (Aphrodité
πόρνη—harlot); in <i>Thessaly</i>; at Tricca; in <i>Boeotia</i>,
(Tanagra—on the Sea); in <i>Attica</i>, (Athens, Colias,
Pera<a id="FNanchor_55_55" href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>, on the Cephissus); in the Islands of the
<i>Aegean Sea</i>, (Ceos, Cos, Samos, where the temple
was built from the earnings of the Hetaerae); in the
<i>Peloponnese</i>: at Argolis, Epidaurus, Troezen, Hermioné,
(was visited by maids and widows before
their marriage); in <i>Laconia</i>, (Amyclae, Cythera);
<i>Arcadia</i>, (Megalopolis, Tegea, Orcomenus); <i>Elis</i>,
(Olympia, Elis); <i>Achaia</i>, (Patrae, Corinth); on the
<i>Coast of the Corinthian Gulf</i>. From Greece we come
to <i>Sicily</i>, where the temple of Venus on Mount
<i>Eryx</i> was hardly inferior to that of Paphos, also at
Syracuse<a id="FNanchor_56_56" href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>.</p>

<p>Not without importance for our purpose is the
statement of <i>Strabo</i><a id="FNanchor_57_57" href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>, that in the island of Cos in
the temple of Aesculapius was an effigy of Venus
Anadyomené (coming from the bath), while according
to <i>Pausanias</i><a id="FNanchor_58_58" href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> in a wood near the temple of the
same god at Epidaurus was built a chapel of Aphrodité,
since very possibly this may throw some light
on the question of the knowledge of complaints of
the genital organs possessed by the physicians of
Cos. <i>Böttiger</i><a id="FNanchor_59_59" href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> is of opinion that it was from the
infirmaries and lazarettos of the Phoenicians that
the earliest medical science of the Greeks was introduced—to
the island of Cos; to Aegina, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
Peloponnesian coasts, especially at Epidaurus. Probably
these establishments were originally under the
protection of the national deity, until the latter was
superseded by the god Aesculapius.</p>

<p>As regards the cult of Aphrodité itself and the
manner in which it was celebrated in Greece, there
appears to be a great lack of particulars capable of
supplying a general knowledge of the subject, and
especially so where the Pandemian Aphrodité is
concerned. Accordingly we will limit ourselves here
to mentioning the female <i>Hieroduli</i><a id="FNanchor_60_60" href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> who as bondswomen
of Aphrodité dwelt within the precinct of
her Temple, and performed the necessary observances
in her honour. These were, as already pointed
out, of Asiatic origin, and to be found in greater
numbers particularly at Ameria<a id="FNanchor_61_61" href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> and Comana<a id="FNanchor_62_62" href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> in
Pontus, where they united with the temple-service
the traffic of their bodies, (τῶν ἐργαζομένων ἀπὸ
τοῦ σώματος—of women who traffic with their
body), just as in later times male Hieroduli gave
up their persons for Paederastia.</p>

<p>When the cult of Venus came into Greece, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
Hieroduli were introduced along with it. But they
stripped off in Greece their Asiatic character, which
they assumed again only in particular sea-port towns
at the period of the decline of the moral greatness
of the Nation, in places where the temple of Aphrodité
Πόρνη (Harlot) was found. Specially was this
so at Corinth<a id="FNanchor_63_63" href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>, in which city were more than a
thousand female Hieroduli, who were presented as
slaves to the Temple. These attracted a great concourse
of strangers to the place, and in particular
used to prey upon sea-faring visitors. Possibly however
in this case as in others a confusion took place
between the Hieroduli properly so-called and the
Hetaerae (Lady-Companions), who were euphemistically
entitled Priestesses, Handmaids of Aphrodité,
because they were under the patronage of that
goddess, just as in a general way sexual enjoyment
was called an offering to Venus.</p>

<p>This would offer the best solution of the question,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
early debated, of the morality of the Hieroduli. It
was quite opposed to Greek feeling to worship
Aphrodité after the Asiatic manner in her temples;
and so the Greek distinguished his Venus Urania
from the Venus Pandemos, and on the same principle
separated her temples into two categories, and
made the temples of Aphrodité Pandemos, Porné
and Praxis (Common to All, Harlot, Sexual Intercourse)
into the οἰκήματα τῆς Ἀφροδίτης (houses
of Aphrodité) serving as ordinary brothels, the latter
being only intended for Foreigners originally.</p>

<p>How and under what form the cult of Venus came
into Italy is uncertain, but the legend represents
Aeneas as having brought it from Troy to Lavinium
and Laurentum<a id="FNanchor_64_64" href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>, and already in the time of Romulus
a Venus Myrtea (Venus of the Myrtle) was venerated
at Rome. In addition a Venus Cloacina, Erycina,
Victrix, and Verticordia (Venus—the Purifier, of
Mount Eryx, of Victory, the Turner of Hearts) are
mentioned, as also a Venus <i>Calva</i> (bald), whose
worship King Ancus is said to have introduced, at
a time when the Roman women had lost their hair
through a plague and it had grown again by the
help of Venus<a id="FNanchor_65_65" href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>. Not only are the notices as to
Venus worship in Italy very scanty, but everything
on the subject points to the fact that what there
was of it in later times showed little of the Asiatic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
impress; and we can conveniently leave the matter
where it is. Some questions belonging to the subject
will be discussed later under the heading <i>Brothels</i>.
In Spain too the worship of Venus was so unimportant
that there is no need to enter more closely
into the point.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="The_Lingam_and_Phallic_Worship">The Lingam and Phallic Worship.</h3>


<h4>§ 6.</h4>

<p>Whilst the cult of Venus sprang up in the interior
of Asia and was disseminated from thence over other
parts of the world, it is in India that the Lingam
ritual took its rise, a ritual more closely corresponding
with the egotism of man. The idea that was
early formed as the result of observation, that the
man’s genitals were the determining element in the
process of generation, was bound to conceive these
organs themselves as being, in the prevailing system
of Pantheism, under the Government of a Deity,
and therefore as specially holy<a id="FNanchor_66_66" href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>. Now how could
this Deity be represented to the eyes of men otherwise
than by that organ whereby he pre-eminently
showed himself efficacious? The later legend it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
true put the matter into another shape; and we find
in <i>Sonnerat</i><a id="FNanchor_67_67" href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> the myth of the Lingam-ritual amongst
the worshippers of Vishnu related in the following form:</p>

<p>“The Penitents had by means of their sacrifices
and prayers attained great power; but their hearts
and their wives’ hearts must ever remain pure, if
they would continue in possession of it. Now Siva
had heard the beauty of these latter highly extolled,
and formed the determination of seducing them.
With this aim in view he took on him the form of
a young mendicant<a id="FNanchor_68_68" href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> of perfect beauty, bade Vishnu
transform himself into a fair maiden and resort to
the spot where the Penitents dwelt, in order to make
them fall in love with him. Vishnu betook himself
thither, and as he passed through their midst threw
them such tender glances that they were all
enamoured. They left all their sacrifices to follow
after the youthful fair one.<a id="FNanchor_69_69" href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

<p>Their passions grew all the fiercer, till at last they
seemed all lifeless and their languishing bodies resembled
wax that melts near the fire.</p>

<p>Siva himself hied to the dwelling-place of the
women. In mendicant guise he carried in one hand
a water-bottle, and sang as he went, as beggars do.
Now his song was so entrancing, that all women
gathered round him, and thereupon under the gaze
of the fair singer fell into complete distraction. This
was so great with some that they lost their ornaments
and clothing, and followed him in the garb
of nature without noticing the fact.</p>

<p>When he had marched through the village, he
left it, but not unaccompanied, for all followed him
into a neighbouring thicket, where he had his will
of them. Soon afterwards the Penitents became
aware that their sacrifices no longer possessed their
former efficacy, and <i>that their power was no more
the same as before</i>. After a period of pious contemplation
they now learned that it had been Siva who
in the form of a Youth had seduced their wives
into profligacy, and that they themselves had been
<i>led astray</i> by Vishnu in the likeness of a Maid.</p>

<p>Accordingly they determined to slay Siva by means
of a sacrifice.</p>

<p>(After many vain attempts), ashamed to have lost
their honour without being able to avenge themselves,
they made a last desperate effort; they united into
one all their prayers and expiations, and directed
them against Siva. It was the most terrible of their
sacrifices, and God himself could not withstand the
effects of its operation. They went forth like a flame
of fire and fastened on Siva’s organs of generation
and severed them from his body. Enraged with the
Penitents, Siva now resolved to set the whole world
in conflagration to punish them. The fire was already
beginning to seize all around, when Vishnu and
Brahma, on whom it was incumbent to save the
living creatures in the world, thought of means to
put a stop to it. Brahma took the form of a pedestal(?)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
and Vishnu that of the female organs of generation,
and in this way copied Siva’s organs of generation,
and thereby the universal conflagration was stayed.
Siva suffered himself to be appeased by their prayers,
and promised not to burn up the world, if men would
pay divine honours to the dissevered organs.”</p>

<p>Now if we consider this myth, as related here,
more closely, we can scarcely avoid the suspicion
that it is one of those that in later times were
fabricated in many forms and foisted in as genuine.
For it is entirely adapted to explain the origin of
the Venereal disease in a way that leaves little to
be desired; for which reason it was used by <i>Schaufus</i>
as the basis of his argument that the Venereal
disease was introduced into Europe from India.
But on the other hand this particular story is so
accordant with the ancient creed of the Hindoos in
general that, if it is of later origin, it must have
been put together with the assistance of older legends.
The continued union with the god, the power which
the Penitents owed to him, was connected with
purity of heart, with avoidance of sensuality<a id="FNanchor_70_70" href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
directly they indulged in the latter, they were deprived
of the divine influence, just as in the Mosaic legend
resulted from the Fall of Man. This is one part of
the legend,—manifestly a double one, while the other
includes the punishment of the being who wrought
this profanation. His genitals were destroyed by
burning, which was attacking the World (i.e. men
through the women seduced by Siva?), and ceased
only through the prayers of the Penitents, which
again became efficacious; thereupon the organs thus
happily made sound again were suspended as thank-offerings
in the temple of the god.</p>

<p>It would seem then that it was the sickness of
the male genitals which gave occasion for their
consecration and worship; and this is so far not
inconsistent with reason, as the external position of
the sexual parts in the male make every affection
and injury perceptible at once with but little
trouble, while the female organs lie in a more
concealed situation. So that to the present day
diseases of the male genitals are far more precisely
known and appreciated than those of the female.</p>

<p>Should the enquirer push his search for an explanation
further still, he might, arguing from what
is said as to Vishnu’s having copied Siva’s sexual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
organs that had been blighted by the fire under
the form of female genitals, allege a sort of natural
cause for the conflagration, to wit the suggestion of
a mode of cure which was frequently recommended
and practised in the Middle Ages, when persons
thought to drive away the clap by coition with
virgins. But this is surely nothing else than an
explanation of the Lingam<a id="FNanchor_71_71" href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> superimposed on the
symbol of the <i>Juni</i>, the feminine principle, in the
form of the triangle, which Böttiger holds to be
identical with the navel-stone of the Paphian goddess.</p>

<p><i>F. G. Klein</i><a id="FNanchor_72_72" href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> professes to have proved from annals
of Malabar that long before the discovery of the
West Indies Venereal disease was known in the
East Indies, for the Malabar physicians <i>Sangarasiar</i>
and <i>Alessianambi</i>, who lived more than nine hundred
years ago, and other physicians even before them,
make mention he says of the Disease and its cure
by means of Mercury. But in Antiquity affections
of the genitals must have certainly been rarities
amongst the inhabitants of India, for the Greeks<a id="FNanchor_73_73" href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a>
count them amongst the longlived peoples, as owing
to their moderation they were subject to few diseases.
Again the climate of India is by no means to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
considered as a factor favourable to the disease,
<i>Munro</i><a id="FNanchor_74_74" href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> assuring us that simple herbs and moderate
mode of life make the Hindoo recover, when no
European could fail to succomb.</p>


<h4>§ 7.</h4>

<p>Whether the Phallus ritual in Egypt, where it is
supposed to have arisen from the generative organs
of Osiris cut off by Typho, have an Indian origin
or no, it is impossible to decide<a id="FNanchor_75_75" href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a>. But that it
existed is certain, for not only are miniature Phalli
often found with Mummies, but it was also portrayed
in the Temple of Karnak<a id="FNanchor_76_76" href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a>; and Herodotus<a id="FNanchor_77_77" href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a>
mentions it, and adds at the same time that in the
statutes the Phalli were <i>movable</i>. Perhaps from it
was developed in part the cult of <i>Mendes</i>, of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
we shall speak later. Although <i>Herodotus</i><a id="FNanchor_78_78" href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> declares
that the Egyptians were the first people who had
forbidden the accomplishment of coition in the
temples, yet <i>Strabo</i><a id="FNanchor_79_79" href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> writes that they dedicated to
Zeus the fairest and best-born maidens, whom the
Greeks called Pallades, and compelled them to give
themselves to men until their menstruation began
for the first time, whereupon they were married.</p>

<p>As regards Greece on the contrary there is
scarcely a doubt that the worship of Bacchus, and
with it the Phallic ritual<a id="FNanchor_80_80" href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>, was transplanted to that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
country from India. To explain the occasion of
this introduction there is a legend related in the
highest degree worthy of attention in connection
with the history of affections of the genitals. It is
told by <i>Natalis Comes</i><a id="FNanchor_81_81" href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> in the following terms:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

<p>“Fuerunt et Phallica in Dionysi honorum instituta,
quae apud Athenienses agebantur, apud quos
primus Pegasus ille Eleutheriensis Bacchi cultum
instituit, in quibus cantabant quem ad modum
Deus hic morbo Athenienses liberavit et quem ad
modum multorum bonorum auctor mortalibus extitit.
Fama est enim quod Pegaso imagines Dionysi ex
Eleutheris civitate Boeotiae in Atticam regionem
portante Athenienses Deum neglexerunt neque, ut
mos erat, cum pompa acceperunt: <em class="gesperrt">quare Deus
indignatus pudenda hominum morbo infestavit,
qui erat illis gravissimus</em>: tunc
eis ab oraculo, quo pacto liberari possent petentibus,
responsum datum est: solum esse remedium malorum
omnium, si cum honore et pompa Deum recepissent;
quod factum fuit. Ex ea re tum privatim tum publice
lignea virilia thyrsis alligantes per eam solennitatem
gestabant. Fuit enim Phallus vocatum membrum
virile. Alii Phallum ideo consecratum Dionyso
putarunt, quia sit autor creditus generationis.”</p>

<p>(There were Phallic rites too established in honour
of Dionysus, (these were observed among the
Athenians; for it was at Athens that the far-famed
Pegasus first established the worship of Eleutherian
Bacchus)<a id="FNanchor_82_82" href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a>, at which men chanted hymns telling how
the god freed the Athenians from a plague, and
how he was the giver of many good gifts to mortals.
For the story relates that Pegasus brought the images
of Dionysus from Eleutherae, a city of Boeotia, to
the land of Attica; but the Athenians slighted the
god, and did not, as was the wont, receive him with
a procession. <i>Wherefore the god was wroth, and
afflicted the men’s private parts with a disease that was
most grievous to them.</i> So they consulted the oracle,
asking in what way they might be freed from the
plague, and received the answer: there was one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
only remedy for all their ills, viz. that they should
welcome the god with due honour and fitting procession.
And this they did accordingly. And in commemoration
thereof they used to bind <i>virilia</i> (male
generative organs) of wood to the thyrsi (Bacchic
staves), and carry them thus at the solemnity in
question; and this was done both privately and
publicly. For <i>Phallus</i> is the name given to a man’s
privy member. Others again considered that it was
consecrate to Dionysus for this reason, because he
was deemed the author of procreation).</p>

<p>Still more striking is the legend which the same
author, <i>Natalis Comes</i><a id="FNanchor_83_83" href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a>, gives of the introduction of
Priapus worship into Lampsacus, though it bears so great
a resemblance to the preceding that the one might almost
be thought to have been taken from the other. Aphrodité,
he says, on the occasion of Bacchus’<a id="FNanchor_84_84" href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> progress to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
India was made pregnant by him, and on her return to
Lampsacus was brought to bed of <i>Priapus</i>, whose
deformity was caused by the goddess Juno<a id="FNanchor_85_85" href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a>, who afforded
succour to the mother at the time of his birth:</p>

<p>“Deinde, cum adolevisset (Priapus) pergratusque
foret Lampsacenis mulieribus, Lampsacenorum
decreto ex agro Lampsaceno exulavit.—Fuerunt
qui memoriae prodiderint Priapum fuisse virum
Lampsacenum, qui cum haberet ingens instrumentum
et facile paratum plantandis civibus, gratissimus
fuerit mulieribus Lampsacenis. Ea causa postmodo
fuisse dicitur, ut Lampsacenorum omnium ceterorum
invidiam in se converterit, ac demum eiectus fuerit
ex ipsa insula. At illud facinus aegerrime ferentibus
mulieribus et pro se deos precantibus, post cum
nonnullis interiectis temporibus <em class="gesperrt">Lampsacenos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
gravissimus pudendorum membrorum
morbus</em> invasisset, Dodonaeum oraculum adeuntes
percunctati sunt an ullum esset eius morbi remedium.
His responsum est: morbum non prius
cessaturum, quam Priapum in patriam revocassent.
Quod cum fecissent, templa et sacrificia illi statuerunt,
Priapumque hortorum Deum esse decreverunt.”</p>

<p>(Subsequently when he—Priapus—had come to
man’s estate, and was now exceedingly pleasing to
the women of Lampsacus, by a decree of the
Lampsacenes he was exiled from the territory of
Lampsacus.—Some there are to tell the tradition
that Priapus was a man of Lampsacus who had a
huge “instrument” ready and willing for the making
of new citizens, and who on that account was most
pleasing to the Lampsacene women. Wherefore it
is said afterwards to have come about that he
incurred the envy and hatred of all the rest of the
men of Lampsacus, and eventually was expelled from
the island altogether. But this was a disaster that
the women most bitterly regretted; so they prayed
to the gods to help them, and after some interval
of time had elapsed <i>a most grievous disease of the
private parts attacked the men of Lampsacus</i>. Then
they reported to the oracle of Dodona, and enquired
of the god if there were any remedy for this plague.
The reply was to the effect that the disease would
not cease till they had recalled Priapus to his
native land. This they did; and furthermore built
temples and established sacrifices in his honour,
and decreed that Priapus should be the god of
gardens).<a id="FNanchor_86_86" href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>

<p>Whatever interpretation we may give to these
legends of Bacchus and Priapus, this much at any
rate may be gathered from them without fear of
contradiction, that affections of the male genitals at
the time when they first became prevalent were taken
to be the original cause of the introduction of Phallic
worship,—in connection with the defloration of virgins
mentioned in § 4. This is not without importance
as bearing on the antiquity of the well-known Indian
legend of the Lingam-ritual; and at the same time
shows clearly that those affections of the genital
organs must have borne a malignant character that
men could not explain to themselves otherwise than
as proceeding from the wrath of a Deity, a deity
who on the other hand alone possessed the power
to remove these ills. Another factor of great importance
in connection with affections of the genitals
in Antiquity, and of all the greater importance in
as much as it leads us to the conclusion that resort
was had for their cure not to human but to divine
assistance, partly indeed depends on reasons which
we shall discuss more exactly later on. However
these reasons may in part be gathered at once from
the following <i>supremely important</i> poem in the
Priapeia<a id="FNanchor_87_87" href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a>, to which <i>de Jurgenew</i> first called attention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
in his Dissertation, p. 11, but without communicating
it in its entirety:</p>

<p>(Why, you ask, is portrayed on the tablet the
member whereby we are begotten? <i>When, as it
befell, my penis was damaged, and like a wretched
coward I dreaded the Surgeon’s hand, I was afraid
to entrust myself and the cure of my organ to the great
official gods, that were too high for me</i>, such I mean
as Phoebus and Phoebus’ son. “To the member,
I said, do thou, Priapus, give aid,—the member that
thou art fashioned in the likeness of<a id="FNanchor_88_88" href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a>. Then when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
it has been healed <i>without the knife</i>, a painted
image of the part thou has relieved shall be dedicated
to thee,—a match, a perfect match in form
and in hue.” Thus he made his vow; the god
nodded his penis in token of assent, and answered
his prayers.)</p>

<p>This poem, whoever its author may have been<a id="FNanchor_89_89" href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a>,
testifies most explicitly that the Poet’s genital organs
were seriously affected (by Phimosis and Ulcers?),
that he from fear (<i>timerem</i>) of the Surgeon’s knife,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
from shame (<i>verebar</i>) before the regular physician in
view of the part affected and of the way in which
he had got the disease, had recourse to prayer and
vow before the image of Priapus, and thereupon
happily recovered without medical assistance!</p>

<p>The veneration of Priapus was pretty well universal
in Italy, as the Roman poets teach us, and equally
so the Phallic worship, of which the frequent representations
of the Phallus that we find at Pompeii
bear witness; in fact the latter, as <i>Knight</i> shows,
maintained itself in connection with the veneration
of Saints <i>Cosmus</i> and <i>Damian</i> down to the last
Century at Isernia. The just quoted Poem from
the Priapeia might perhaps serve to afford us an
indication as to how the Phallus ritual has come
to be connected with these Christian Saints; for
probably patients attacked by the Venereal disease
prayed to them, just as the Romans did to Priapus.
Possibly examples of such cures by the saints in
question are found in the “Acta Sanctorum Bollandi”.
(Bollandist Lives of the Saints),—under Sept.
27.; but we are not able to consult the book. These
Saints however were not the only ones that were
venerated in the Middle Ages in the same way as
the Priapus of the Ancients. In France unfruitful
wives used to pray to St. Guerlichon, in Normandy
to St. Giles, in Anjou to St. René, in connection
with whom they practised rites which <i>Stephanus</i>
declares himself ashamed to specify<a id="FNanchor_90_90" href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a>.</p>

<h4>§ 8.</h4>

<p>Although the period at which the worship of
Priapus was introduced among the different Peoples
cannot be always definitely fixed, and although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
Classical Mythology invariably counts him as belonging
to the newer<a id="FNanchor_91_91" href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> gods, yet he appears in quite
early times to have played a not unimportant part
in Syria<a id="FNanchor_92_92" href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a>,—if that is to say the conclusion<a id="FNanchor_93_93" href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a>, pretty
generally believed on other grounds, is well founded,
that the god Baal Peor was a sort of Priapus, in
whose temple, situated on Mount Peor<a id="FNanchor_94_94" href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a>, young
Maidens were offered up. The Rabbis<a id="FNanchor_95_95" href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> derive the
name from פְּעוֹר <i>aperire</i> sc. <i>hymenem virgineum</i>, (to
open <i>sc.</i> the hymen of a virgin), as if it had sprung
from the Phallus ritual, as still found in Italy. At
Goa indeed a man’s member made of iron or ivory
is fastened in the Pagoda, which in the case of
every bride is pushed by the parents and relations
into her vagina, until it brings away with it visibly the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
bloody traces of the rupture of the hymen<a id="FNanchor_96_96" href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a>; a
proceeding that is connected, as shown in § 4., with
the belief in the malignity of the menstrual blood,
and in that of blood coming from the ruptured
hymen. On the Coromandel Coast likewise a wooden
Priapus is to the present day most ardently venerated
by the inhabitants<a id="FNanchor_97_97" href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a>.</p>

<p>Here again we encounter a legend, which is not
without importance for the history of the affections
consequent upon the misuse of the genital organs,
to wit the story of the <i>Plague</i> that broke out amongst
the Jews at Shittim in consequence of their having
taken part in the worship of Baal-Peor. <i>Sickler</i><a id="FNanchor_98_98" href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a>
was the first who, as a champion of the antiquity
of the Venereal disease, made this the subject of a
more precise examination. However, in order to
obtain as clear an insight into the matter as possible,
it will be needful to quote at length the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
passages of the Old Testament connected with the
subject, according to the English Revised Version<a id="FNanchor_99_99" href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a>:</p>

<h4>§ 9.</h4>

<p>We find the Jews on their march towards Canaan
already arrived at the Jordan, from which river
Shittim lay at a distance of 60 Stades or 2-1/2 leagues
according to <i>Josephus</i><a id="FNanchor_101_101" href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a>, and the neighbouring Peoples
in a state of terror at their near approach and at
their victories. The King of the Moabites, Balak,
had sent to the soothsayer Balaam, that the latter
by his arts (his curse) might annihilate the threatening
foe. Balaam however, inspired by the spirit of the
Lord, blessed the sons of Israel instead of cursing
them, but gave Balak counsel how he could in
another way bring about the ruin of the Jews. This
counsel is indicated in the passage quoted, Numbers
Ch. 31, v. 16, without being explicitly stated; but
what it was can indeed be partially gathered from
the context of the whole passage, and was apparently
so understood by the author of the Apocalypse,
when he says:<a id="FNanchor_102_102" href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> “But I have a few things against
thee, because thou hast there some that hold the
teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a
stumblingblock before the children of Israel, <i>to eat
things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication</i>.”
Both <i>Philo</i> and <i>Josephus</i>, who perhaps lived only a
little later, picture the course of events in full detail,
though, it is true, from unknown authorities.</p>

<p><i>Philo</i><a id="FNanchor_103_103" href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> writes as follows:</p>

<p>“Quae prius, inquit (Bileam), dixi oracula sunt

adversariorum velut hamis capient. Ita autem

recusationis libidinem acrius excitabit, et amorem
accendet, actique libidine tanquam obtorto collo

<p>(All my words, said he (Balaam), thus far are dark
sayings and prophecies; what I shall speak henceforth
will be the counsels of my own mind.—But
come let us look into his excellent advice, in what
artful ways it has been framed for the sure and
certain destruction of our ever-victorious foes. For
perceiving that the Hebrews could be overcome in
one fashion only, viz. through their violating the law
by some terrible wrongdoing, he set himself, employing
the bait of lust, to lead them on by way of fornication
and incontinence, great offences in themselves,
to the still greater crime of impiety. For this land,
he said, oh! King, far excels all others in the beauty
of its women; and by no other thing may men’s
minds be so readily mastered as by a woman’s
fairness. So if thou suffer the fairest amongst them
to play the harlot and offer their beauty for a price,
they will catch the young men of our enemies, so
to speak, on their hooks. But they must be instructed
not to surrender the enjoyment of their persons
straightway at the first offer. For the sharp sting
of a feigned refusal will, as thou knowest, excite
their longing more keenly than ever, and inflame
their passion, till driven on by lustfulness they are
dragged along, as it were, by a halter round their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
necks, and there is nothing they will not consent to
do or suffer. Accordingly the lover that each of the
fair women who are set on to this task has won
for herself and brought to this condition, must be
bluntly told: It is impossible for thee to enjoy my
love unless thou break with the customs of thy
fathers, and change thy heart, and undertake the
observance of the same rites as we. And this
desertion of thy people’s faith will I then only hold
as manifested, when I shall see thee willing to partake
in those same libations and sacrifices that we
are wont duly to pay to our idols and statues and
other images.—Now such was the advice Balaam
then offered; and the King deeming that he spake
much to the purpose, repealed the law as to unlawful
intercourse, and removed all punishments for
fornication and licentious conduct, and made them
as though they had never been, giving free licence
to the women to lie with any man they pleased.
And the latter, permission being granted and impunity
guaranteed, soon ensnared a great number
of the young Jewish warriors, whose minds indeed
had long beforehand been entangled and by every
trick and allurement impelled towards impiety.</p>

<p>At the last the high-priest’s son, Phinehas, above
measure indignant at such deeds of shame, and
convinced that both souls and bodies were at one
and the same time being enslaved, the one by
sensual pleasures, the other by wickedness and craft
and impiety<a id="FNanchor_104_104" href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a>, did a deed at once memorable for
youthful daring, and worthy of a hero. For when
he saw a kinsman of his own and one of the priestly
order go in to a harlot, and this without any look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
of shame fixed on the ground, without any attempt
at concealment, without any stealing up privily and
making, as men are wont in such a case, a surreptitious
entrance, but instead carrying it off with an
air of shameless self-confidence and bearing himself
proudly as though his act were one to merit renown
and not ridicule, he was fired by the indignity, and
filled with righteous anger rushes up and bursts in
on the lover and his wanton actually lying on the
bed. He pierces them through, and furthermore
cuts away those organs wherewith they were satisfying
their unholy passion. This example was
followed, by command of Moses, by other zealous
partisans of purity and religion; and those who had
been initiated into the service of idols died the death
at the hands of their family and kinsfolk, and so
the wickedness of the nation was expiated by a
merciless punishment of the wrongdoers;—and in
one day four and twenty thousand men were slain,
and thereby was straightway removed the common
stain wherewith the whole host was spotted and
polluted).</p>

<p>In much the same way, only still more fully,
<i>Josephus</i><a id="FNanchor_105_105" href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> relates the circumstance. Licentiousness
had laid hold of almost the entire host, and ancestral
institutions were in danger of being abandoned
altogether. Consequently, Josephus says, Moses
appointed an assemblage of the People and in a
speech drew attention to the perils that threatened.
Sambrias (Simri) however made a defence, maintaining
that they had long enough obeyed tyrannous
laws and would fain live free henceforth. Hereupon
he quitted the assembly, and was assassinated in
his tent by the enraged Phinehas. Josephus (§ 12.)
proceeds:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>
<p>“Iuvenes autem omnes, qui virtutis aliquid sibi
vindicarent et honestatis studio tenerentur, Phineesis
fortitudinis exemplo accensi, eiusdem cum Zambria
criminis reos interfecerunt. Multi itaque illorum,
qui leges patrias violarant, horum egregia virtute
perempti sunt. Peste autem reliqui omnes perierunt,
deo hunc illis morbum immittente. Et quotquot
e cognatis, qui cum prohibere debuerint, eos ad
haec impulerant, a deo pro sceleris sociis habiti,
pariter sublati erant.”<a id="FNanchor_106_106" href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></p>

<p>(But all the younger men who laid any claim to
manly virtue and tried to live honorably, fired by
the example of Phinehas’ bold deed, slew all that
were guilty of the same crime as Sambrias. And so
by their singular courage and patriotism numbers of
the men who had broken their ancestral laws were
destroyed. But all that survived perished by a
plague, that God sent upon them. Moreover such
of their kinsfolk as ought to have hindered them,
but instead had urged them to these courses, these
God deemed accomplices in the wickedness, and
they also were cut off.) Philo and Josephus are
not indeed to be regarded as authentic eye-witnesses
of what they record; still the passages quoted
from them prove this much, that in their time the
opinions they express were generally held.</p>

<p>The Jews were thus led astray by the daughters
of the Moabites, and both practised fornication with
them and made sacrifice in their temples to the god
of the country, whose priestesses, as Balaam declared,
were conspicuous above other women for their
beauty. The <i>consequence</i> of these excesses was an
infectious disease, (according to <i>Josephus</i> it communicated
itself, but, he says, only to kinsmen!), which
cost many<a id="FNanchor_107_107" href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> their lives. The number however fell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
far short of 24000, for these perished mainly by the
sword of their brethren, as <i>Philo</i> and <i>Josephus</i>
expressly remark, and the author of the Pentateuch
intimates, when he says (Numbers Ch. 26. v. 5.),
“And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye
every one his men that have joined themselves unto
Baal-Peor.” The narrator declares that by this
slaughter the plague was stayed for the sons of
Israel; but it certainly cannot have ceased altogether,
as is manifest from the passages quoted from
Joshua, where Phinehas asserts: that to that day the
people was not yet cleansed from the misdoing of
Peor.</p>

<p>The disease therefore cannot have been merely
some passing disorder. It must evidently have been
somewhat widely disseminated by the Moabitish
women, and have been of very common occurrence
among them; and that it was readily infectious
follows from the whole course of Moses’ proceedings.
The latter was angry because the woman had been
suffered to live, and commanded to put to death
all of them that had known men in carnal intercourse,
but to keep alive the young virgins,—and
their number was, according to Ch. 31. v. 35.,
thirty-two thousand!—who were brought into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
camp as prisoners and there divided amongst their
captors. So we see the executions took place not
in order that opportunity for intercourse with the
heathen women,—a thing which might very well on
its own account have been an abomination to the
Lord,—might be altogether removed, (for how in that
case account for the maidens being saved alive,
brought into camp, and divided as booty?)<a id="FNanchor_108_108" href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> but that
by this means the risk of the further dissemination
of the disease might be for ever prevented.</p>

<p>The imminence of this risk in Moses’ opinion is
shown finally by the purification of the host which
he had despatched for the massacre of the Moabites
and their women. He made it, prisoners and all
the spoil included, halt for a period of seven days
outside the camp, and twice over submit to a thorough
purification. The Jews had slain many thousands
of men in their previous wars, nay! just before they
marched against the Moabites, they had actually
slaughtered 24000 of their own youth; yet they had
never been ordered to leave the camp for seven
days, and twice over during this time to purify
themselves and all their possessions. Only after the
annihilation of the Moabitish women (not of the
Moabite men), from the accomplishment of which
they had just returned, had this happened. All this
points to some most cogent reason. Here comes
into operation the same law which was enforced on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
occasion of purification after Leprosy and after foul
discharge: and indeed also after contact with a dead
person,—even where they had first caused the death
of the said person! Thus no one can very well
dispute the view taken by <i>Philo</i>,<a id="FNanchor_109_109" href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> when he says with
regard to the purification after the annihilation of
the Moabites:—</p>

<p>“Nam ut legitima hostium caedes sit, attamen qui
hominem interfecit quamquam iure, quamquam vim
propulsans, quamquam coactus, non insons esse
videtur nec extra noxiam, propter summam illam
et communem hominum inter ipsos cognationem.
Quo nomine piacula suscipienda fuerunt interfectoribus
ad luendum scelus, quod conceptum censebatur.”</p>

<p>(For whereas the slaying of enemies is lawful,
nevertheless whosoever has killed a man, whether
lawfully, or whether initiating the violent act, or
whether on compulsion, seems not to be innocent
or free from responsibility; and this is owing to that
supreme and general relationship of all mankind
with one other. Wherefore certain expiations had
to be undertaken by any man who had killed another,
to wipe out the guilt that was deemed to have been
incurred).</p>

<p>What was the precise nature of the disease that
the Jews had brought on themselves by their intercourse
with the Moabitish women cannot indeed be
determined; but that it affected the genital organs
can hardly admit of a doubt. The fact, if it is a
fact, that not a few lost their lives owing to it,
need be no objection, since the ulceration of the
genitals that prevailed at the end of the XVth.
Century caused similar fatalities, and as we shall
presently see, the uncircumcised <i>Apion</i> met his death
in some such way. Now the Jews were almost
without exception still uncircumcised at that time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
for it was <i>Joshua</i><a id="FNanchor_110_110" href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> who first on his arrival in Canaan,
at the bidding of Jehovah, circumcised the children
of Israel with stone knives on the hill Araloth.
When the people adopted the worship of Baal Peor,
we may be sure they ceased at the same time to
observe the ancestral laws of purification,—if indeed
these latter even as regards foul discharge and
leprosy as well as intercourse with women during
menstruation were not perhaps, as might almost be
believed, <i>first</i> enacted in all their severity only in
consequence of the plague of Baal Peor. Again it
may well have been this experience that first taught
the inhabitants of Palestine the necessity of circumcision,
which was then laid down as an ordinance
by command of Jehovah!</p>

<h4>§ 10.</h4>

<p>There is no doubt that it was in the Asiatic cult
of Venus that the first elements were given for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
sexual excesses. It is hardly a matter of surprise
therefore if these same elements came constantly,
as has been shown above, into greater and greater
prominence, and in this way pushed the original
form of the Worship into the background. By
degrees as enlightenment increased and the respect
felt towards the gods diminished, Venus also soon
lost her old character as goddess of procreation and
sank into the patroness of sensual gratification. Her
temples as well as her holy groves lost their exclusive
title to bestow the blessing of fruitfulness on
the embraces of the sexes, and came merely to
serve as appointed trysting-places of carnal pleasures.
The offerings made at her shrines were no longer
to win an assurance of posterity; they became bribes
paid to buy a free opportunity for the indulgence of
sensuality. They degenerated into fornication-fees,
as her temples did into brothels. The priestesses
of Astarté or Mylitta stood at the beck and call
alike of strangers and natives, and the opportunity
was ever open for sexual enjoyment. Hence too it
is that a special designation for the brothel will be
looked for in vain in Asia. The thing existed there
without the name being required; and the State
found no need to establish an institution, which had
long ago, without any intervention on its part, taken
form under the cloak of religion.</p>

<p>Even amongst <i>the Jews</i>, who frequently enough,
but always as a temporary aberration merely, adhered
to the foreign cult, brothels in the strict sense seem
never to have existed<a id="FNanchor_112_112" href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a>. Although courtesans are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
frequently mentioned in the Old Testament, and
even the dwelling of a Wanton as well as her
behaviour pictured with considerable fullness of
detail<a id="FNanchor_113_113" href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a>, yet all this would seem to have had more
of a private than of a public character,—due heed
being given to the fact that not a few passages are
to be taken only in a figurative sense. Prostitution
as a regular calling was strictly prohibited<a id="FNanchor_114_114" href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> to the
daughters of Israel; and such women as practised
it openly seem to have been mainly foreigners,
perhaps natives of Phoenicia and Syria, who at the
same time entertained with dancing and the music
of stringed instruments<a id="FNanchor_115_115" href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a>. But the attempt to draw
a conclusion from this as to the pre-eminent chastity
of the Jewish women, as e.g. <i>Beer</i> (on p. 25 loco
citato) wishes to do, would be justifiable neither for
earlier nor yet for later times. The passages of the
Old Testament dealing with Sodom and with the
dissoluteness under Mannasseh even in the very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
Temple at Jerusalem are sufficient by themselves to
prove the contrary.</p>

<p>As to <i>Macedonia</i> there is a passage in <i>Athenaeus</i>,
quoted from <i>Hermesianax</i> to this effect: ἀλλὰ
Μακεδονίης πάσας κατενίσατο λαύρας (But he
went through all the alleys of Macedonia), where
<i>Dalechamp</i> translates the word λαύρα by brothel,
but <i>Casaubon</i> even in his time threw doubt on this
rendering.<a id="FNanchor_116_116" href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> Possibly however this judgement is connected
with similar licentious practises among the
Macedonians to what we find among the Persians<a id="FNanchor_117_117" href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a>,
who indulged in sexual intercourse with their own
mothers, daughters, etc., and begat children upon
them,—a practice which <i>Euripides</i><a id="FNanchor_118_118" href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> makes the Barbarians
generally guilty of.</p>

<p>But if there <i>were</i> actually brothels existing in
Macedonia, this would be the less surprising, as its
inhabitants may well be reckoned amongst Greeks
in many respects.</p>

<p>The Greek knew perfectly the boundary between
the physical and the ethical, and sought ever to
subordinate the former to the latter. His whole life
belonged in the first instance to the State, of it he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
was bound to be a citizen, and for it to endeavour
to produce good citizens. Consequently polygamy
early disappeared in Greece, and so too community
of wives, a custom which prevailed down to historical
times at Sparta only. Monogamy was the first
law of marriage, and marriage was the bounden
duty of every true citizen<a id="FNanchor_119_119" href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a>, to save his family from
dying out. But while the Asiatic prided himself on
the number of his children, the Greek’s boast was
of their excellence. Only with the object of procreating
offspring was the Greek husband to rest in the
arms of his spouse (ἐπ’ ἀρότῳ παίδων γνησίων—for
the sowing, procreation of lawful children), and not
to desecrate the holy Torus (marriage-couch) by
mere lustfulness. Where this was stirred in him, he
ceased to be free; a slave of lust, he must consort
only with slave-women, and not with free citizenesses<a id="FNanchor_120_120" href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a>.
Nay! even this was permitted solely to
avoid greater evils; and illicit coition never ceased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
to be held as something οὐ καλόν—unseemly<a id="FNanchor_121_121" href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a>,
particularly when it was indulged in by married men.</p>

<p>It has been shown how under the clearer skies
of Greece the Asiatic worship of Venus took on a
form more worthy of mankind, how the Greek
distinguished his Venus Urania (Heavenly Venus)
from the Venus of the rest of the world, the Pandemian
(Venus common to all), and so set up a
barrier to the flood of dissoluteness,—a barrier however
that was little by little broken down in later
times. Foreigners, especially the voluptuous inhabitants
of Asia, when they saw that the Greek cult
did not like their native worship abet their carnal
appetites, imported slave-women. These were purchased
by the Greeks, and handed over as offerings
to the temple of Aphrodité under the title of
Temple-servants or “Hieroduli”<a id="FNanchor_122_122" href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a>; and acquainted as
they were with the needs of their fellow-countrymen,
sought in every way to supply them,—as was
in particular the case at Corinth.</p>

<p>This example could not well remain without
influence on private life. The Greek indeed took
no part in the Asiatic form of the Venus-worship;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
all the same illicit connection grew more and more
universally prevalent, and as it could not be gratified
in any other way, wives<a id="FNanchor_123_123" href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> and daughters of fellow-citizens
were imperilled. To avert this danger <i>Solon</i>
(B. C. 594) according to the statements of <i>Philemon</i>
and <i>Nicander</i><a id="FNanchor_124_124" href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> introduced actual <i>brothels</i>, οἴκημα,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
πορνεῖον, (house, brothel) and public women, πόρναι
(prostitutes), who were accessible at a trifling charge.
The houses of ill-fame were situated, as <i>Pollux</i>
informs us, at Athens in the neighbourhood of the
Harbour<a id="FNanchor_125_125" href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a>, and in the Ceramicus according to <i>Hesychius</i><a id="FNanchor_126_126" href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a>,
in later times also in the city itself<a id="FNanchor_127_127" href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a>. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
were presided over by a Whoremaster (πορνοβοσκός,
πορνοτρόφος—harlot-maintainer, harlot-keeper). As
to the internal arrangements of brothels among the
Greeks we have been unable so far to discover
anything more precise, but in all probability the same
conditions held good as among the Romans.</p>

<p>Besides the regular brothels, women were also
kept at the taverns<a id="FNanchor_128_128" href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> (καπηλεία, καπηλεῖον, καπήλιον,
πανδοκεῖα,—tavern, inn), which likewise were situated
chiefly near the Port. The women were bought
slaves, as the passages quoted above (p. 70. note 2.)
show; and even such free Greek women<a id="FNanchor_129_129" href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> as at a
later period undertook the calling, were then looked
upon as slaves<a id="FNanchor_130_130" href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a>. All women of this class, as well
as the whore-masters, were professionally under the
supervision of the Ἀγορανόμοι (Market Commissioners<a id="FNanchor_131_131" href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a>,
who fixed how much each was allowed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
receive for her services. This fee was called μίσθωμα,
διάγραμμα or ἐμπολή,—fee, scale, purchase). It
varied in amount;—8 Chalci— = 1 obol, a little
less than twopence (τριαντοπόρνη,—an obol, two-penny,
girl)<a id="FNanchor_132_132" href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a>, 2 obols— = about three-pence halfpenny
(διωβολιμαῖα, χαλκιδῖτις,—a two obol, three-pence
halfpenny, girl)<a id="FNanchor_133_133" href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a>, a drachma—a franc, say ten-pence<a id="FNanchor_134_134" href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a>,
a Stater—= 4 drachmae, say three and three-pence
(στατηριαία,—a stater, three and three-penny, girl).<a id="FNanchor_135_135" href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></p>

<p>The Hetaera (Lady-Companion) seems in this
respect to have enjoyed a greater liberty of choice,
and a knowledge of their prices to have been
regarded as something out of the common<a id="FNanchor_136_136" href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a>. The
well-known <i>Gnathaena</i> at Athens asked 1000 Drachmae
for a night from a foreign Satrap<a id="FNanchor_137_137" href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a>; <i>Phryné</i> a
mina (= 100 drachmae, something over four pounds
sterling). But the most notorious of all was <i>Lais</i>
at Corinth for the high price at which she sold
the marks of her favour, from which arose the
proverb: Non cuivis homini contingit adire Corinthum,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
(It is not every man that can go to Corinth)<a id="FNanchor_138_138" href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a>.</p>

<p>Licences to follow the calling were granted to the
whore-masters, and also the women, on payment of
a fixed duty, called “prostitute tax” (τέλος πορνικόν)<a id="FNanchor_139_139" href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
which was leased out yearly by the Magistracy, and
collected by professional <i>farmers of the prostitution-tax</i>
or Collectors, known as πορνοτελώναι, who kept
a complete list, in which were included even the
“Pathici” (pathic sodomites), of all liable to the
impost. From the proceeds of this prostitution-tax
<i>Solon</i> would seem to have built a temple at Athens
to Aphrodité Pandemos<a id="FNanchor_140_140" href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a>. From this an idea may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
be formed, even if nothing more than a sort of
brothel is to be understood by the term, of the
large number of women of this character and of the
considerable revenue of the city.</p>

<p>The public women were either such as lived in
the brothels (πόρναι, αἱ προστᾶσαι τῶν οἰκημάτων,—harlots,
prostitutes of the “houses”), where they
used to stand at the doors, and that in rows (ἐπὶ
κέρως τεταγμένας,—drawn up in column) more or
less stripped, in almost transparent dresses (γυμναὶ,
ἐν λεπτοπήνοις ὑμέσιν,—stripped, in fine-woven
robes)<a id="FNanchor_141_141" href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a>, or else they were kept partly as ἑταῖραι
μουσικαί—“musical” hetaerae, like the harp-girls
in German beer-halls, or with procurers (μαστροπός,
προαγωγός,—bawds, procurers) in their taverns
(προαγωγεῖα, μαστρόπιον, ματρύλλεια,—procurer’s
house, bawdy-house, brothel). Or again they followed
their trade in the Port-Market (the δεῖγμα) as
δεικτηριάδες (Market-girls)<a id="FNanchor_142_142" href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a>, in the στοὰ μακρὰ,
(Long Portico), and generally in the Lanes of
that neighbourhood (χαμαιτύπαι<a id="FNanchor_143_143" href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a>, χαμαιευνάδες,
χαμαιεύνης, χαμαιτηρίς, χαμεύνης,—all nick-names
for common strumpets, “ground-thumpers,” “sleepers
on the ground”), where they either surrendered themselves
on the spot or hied to recognised harlots’
dens (χαμαιτυπεῖον) or houses of accommodation
(τέγος)<a id="FNanchor_144_144" href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

<p>The place of their abode shows at once what
class of men frequented “filles de joye” of the sort.
It was foreign sailors<a id="FNanchor_145_145" href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> in particular who here
indemnified themselves for their compulsory continence
at sea. Of Greeks only the dregs of the
people and debauchees who had lost all self-respect
came here; and even these used by preference the
taverns<a id="FNanchor_146_146" href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a>, where procuration was carried on as well<a id="FNanchor_147_147" href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a>,—for
which reason they had fallen into general
disrepute. For as late as Aristophanes’<a id="FNanchor_148_148" href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> time the
lower class of citizens felt no hesitation about taking
their pleasure along with their wives in inns. On
the other hand persons of repute, prominent by
office and dignities, were actually forbidden by law
to visit such places. “Were an Areopagite to have
been seen but once in an Inn,” says <i>Hyperides</i><a id="FNanchor_149_149" href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a>,
“his colleagues would no longer have tolerated him
as a member of the Areopagus.” Later, matters
changed, for the moralizing <i>Isocrates</i><a id="FNanchor_150_150" href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> says, “Nay!
no well-conducted slave dares even eat or drink
anything in an Inn”; and <i>Theophrastus</i>, portraying
the character of a madman quite devoid of shame
gives this as a trait,—he would be quite capable of
keeping an Inn!</p>

<p>The hetaera (female-companion) must be distin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>guished
from the πόρνη (harlot), though both were
under similar conditions as to police surveillance.
The hetaera was also strictly speaking a slave-woman,
usually stolen as a child or otherwise obtained by
procuresses, or bought by older hetaerae. They
were educated<a id="FNanchor_151_151" href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> in all that was understood by the
Ancients under the name “Music”, that over and
above their charms of person, they might especially
captivate their lovers by their intellectual cultivation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
who bought them to give them their freedom,—and
then more often than not were presently abandoned
by them. The great nursery of hetaerae was above
all places Corinth, from which centre they travelled
through all parts of Greece, as e.g. did Neaera, and
frequently acquired enormous riches. The better
class of them were everywhere held in high esteem;
and many a hetaera, grown weary of her condition,
gave her hand to a husband, in order to close her
life as an honest wife<a id="FNanchor_152_152" href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a>, or else retired so as at any
rate to lead a blameless existence<a id="FNanchor_153_153" href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a>. Frequently
indeed they were also “Dames de Maison”, and
often kept a considerable number of girls under the
title of hand-maids. This was the case with Nicareta,
just mentioned, at Corinth, as well as with the
famous Aspasia at Athens, the latter of whom flooded
all Hellas with her protegées<a id="FNanchor_154_154" href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a>. Such as were held
in less respect often put themselves under the protection
of their more renowned sisters, or else carried
on the calling on their own account, and this especially
when they were not so well educated, not “musical”
(πεζαι ἑταιραι—<i>prose lady-companions</i>)<a id="FNanchor_155_155" href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a>, at Athens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
going to settle at the Peiraeus to entice the merchants
who arrived in the port, whilst the more choice
merely showed themselves there<a id="FNanchor_156_156" href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a>. They often
followed the troops on service in crowds, accompanying
for instance the general <i>Chares</i><a id="FNanchor_157_157" href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> and <i>Pericles</i>
to Samos, where they made so large an income that
they even built a temple of Ἀφροδίτη ἐν Καλάμοις
(Aphrodité at Calami,—the Reeds)<a id="FNanchor_158_158" href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a>. For the remaining
details as to the life of the hetaerae the classical
Treatise of <i>Friedrich Jacobs</i><a id="FNanchor_159_159" href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> should be consulted.</p>

<p>Even these regular “filles de joie” at first existed
almost exclusively for foreigners, who often squandered
prodigious sums in their arms; the Athenians
at any rate up to the time of Themistocles did not
go with them<a id="FNanchor_160_160" href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a>. But the example proved too strong
to resist. Little by little the younger men acquired
a taste for the freer society of the highly educated
and luxuriously bedecked<a id="FNanchor_161_161" href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> courtesans, who on their
side were possessed of tact enough to subordinate
the purely sensual to the intellectual, in order to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
captivate the Greek sense of beauty. Even older
men might easily be seen at their feet, for the Greek
ladies had but too little aptitude for stepping beyond
the household sphere<a id="FNanchor_162_162" href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a>. And so it was no longer
matter for surprise when <i>Chares</i> took with him on
his expedition, as stated above, a large number of
hetaerae. The Athenian youth was already in the
habit of killing time in their society<a id="FNanchor_163_163" href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a>; and the
important rôle they played in the time of <i>Pericles</i>
needs to be no further insisted on. The Greek however
never descended to the lowest level of shameless,
brutal, coarseness. Before he threw himself into the
arms of the foreign Wanton, he first raised her to
some equality with himself; and of the handmaid
and slave made a friendly companion or hetaera!</p>

<p>The account here given applies particularly only
to Athens, for our efforts to discover anything more
precise as to brothels and courtesans in the remaining
States and Cities of Greece have not so far been
crowned with success.</p>

<h4>§ 11.</h4>

<p>With the Roman, who could spare hardly a
thought to any other feeling than his pride, love
played but an insignificant rôle in his existence.
Even the deference he showed towards marriage and
the married woman was not really so much the
outcome of a pure morality as of the interest that
the State must of necessity feel in the nursing-mothers
of each succeeding generation; in fact it
can scarcely be regarded as much more than a
mere measure of policy. When a Censor like <i>Metellus</i>
in a public Speech intended to encourage matrimony
could say<a id="FNanchor_164_164" href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a>: Si sine uxore possemus, Quirites, esse,
omnes ea molestia careremus: sed quoniam ita natura
tradidit, ut nec cum illis satis commode, nec sine
illis ullo modo vivi possit, saluti perpetuae potius
quam brevi voluptati consulendum. (If we could live
without a wife, Quirites, we should all be free from
such inconvenience; but since nature has arranged
it in this wise that neither with women in any real
comfort, nor without them at all, can existence be
carried on, we ought to think of our life-long well-being
rather than of a momentary gratification),—and
when even the strict <i>Cato</i> declared<a id="FNanchor_165_165" href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a>: In adulterio
uxorem tuam si deprehendisses, sine iudicio impune
necares: illa te, si adulterares, digito non auderet
contingere, <em class="gesperrt">neque ius est</em>. (If you should have
detected your wife in adultery, you might kill her
without trial and be scatheless; but she, if <i>you</i> were
the adulterer, would not dare to lay a finger upon
you, <i>nor is it lawful</i> she should),—it can hardly
surprise us to find a complete lack of the ideal or
intellectual element in the relations of the sexes.
These never really rose among the Romans much
above the level of the bestial; and harlots are found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
already in evidence at the very threshold of Roman
history<a id="FNanchor_166_166" href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a>, whilst association with them far from ever
being a subject of blame, is rather represented as
being a custom sanctified by immemorial usage that
had never been forbidden<a id="FNanchor_167_167" href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a>.</p>

<p>In spite of this however, and of the fact that the
<i>Etruscans</i><a id="FNanchor_168_168" href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a>, at a time when Rome was hardly more
than <i>coming</i> into existence, already led a life that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
was worse than licentious, while <i>Messapians</i>, <i>Samnites</i>
and <i>Locrians</i>, as has been shown, habitually gave
up their daughters to prostitution,—in spite of all
this I say, the sexual excesses of the Romans were
for the first 500 years on the whole insignificant.
Their way of life as warriors and husbandmen hardly
suffered them to sink into indolent sloth, the beginning
of all vicious living, whilst the law of the
XII Tables, “<i>coelibes prohibeto</i>” (be it forbidden to
remain bachelors)<a id="FNanchor_169_169" href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> forced men in the vigour of their
powers to satisfy the impulse of nature in the arms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
of the lawful wife. But more and more did the
Romans come into contact with foreign Peoples, and
began to adopt more and more their customs and
vices. In the year 513 A.U.C. (B.C. 240) the
Floralia were introduced, which even granting they
cannot have had the origin that <i>Lactantius</i><a id="FNanchor_170_170" href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> assigns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
them, yet by the very nature of the celebrations
were an outrage on all good morals. Yet so universally
popular were they that <i>Cato</i> could win no
greater concession to his indignant zeal against them
than that their closing scenes should be delayed
until he had retired<a id="FNanchor_171_171" href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a>.</p>

<p>The enormous wealth the Romans had won as
booty in their continual Wars of spoliation, could
not be hoarded unused, it must be enjoyed; and
how enjoyed, the warriors knew already. The
younger members of the Equestrian and Patrician
orders went on travels, and learned in the arms of
Greek and Asiatic wantons how to lavish their money
<i>secundum artem</i>. Then on their return to Rome
finding the native Scorta (common harlots) no longer
to their taste, they brought home with them their
freed-woman “Amica” (Mistress), who was a fair
match for the Greek hetaera in greed, if not in
refinement. It was not long before the old-fashioned
Roman matron succumbed in the struggle with her
for supremacy, and by dint of her only too successful
endeavours to outdo the foreign courtesan
in <i>recherché</i> vice and effrontery, became but the more
despicable in the eyes of the proud Roman. She
had indeed learned to be a mother, but not to love.
At the same time the Roman himself, surrounded
as he thus was by no softening influences, ceased
not only to be a citizen of the state, but even to
be a man at all; and the Ruler of the World sank
at last to such a depth of exaggerated viciousness
that it became his glory and boast to be without
a rival in its enormity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

<p>The conclusion then is indisputable that only
subsequently to the Wars in Asia was Roman
morality undermined<a id="FNanchor_172_172" href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a>. At the same time it is
impossible from the information given above to
assign any definite point of time at which brothels
and public women came into vogue at Rome, or at
any rate when their existence as such was officially
recognized by those in charge of the police super<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>vision
of the city. With the regulations and arrangements
however we are more precisely acquainted.
The brothels, <i>lupanaria</i><a id="FNanchor_173_173" href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">173</a>, <i>fornicas</i><a id="FNanchor_174_174" href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">174</a>, were situated
chiefly in the Second District (Secunda Regio) of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
the city<a id="FNanchor_175_175" href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">175</a>, the <i>Coelimontana</i>, particularly in the Subura
(Suburbana) that bordered the town-walls, lying in
the Carinae,—the valley between the Coelian and
Esquiline Hills. In the same district was the <i>Macellum
magnum</i>, or Great Market, for all sorts of provisions<a id="FNanchor_176_176" href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">176</a>
along the banks of the Tiber, as well as the Cookshops,
Stalls or Shops (Tabernae)—of the Barbers,
even of the Public Executioner<a id="FNanchor_177_177" href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">177</a>, and the Castra
peregrina, (Foreign Camp), barracks for foreign troops
quartered in Rome under the Emperors as a garrison,—all
circumstances that occasioned a great concourse
of men<a id="FNanchor_178_178" href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">178</a>. To the North the Subura marched with
the “Isis and Serapis”,—the Third District (Tertia
Regio), where was situated the temple of Isis with
its gardens and groves. The regular brothels are
pictured to us as being in the highest degree uncleanly
and dirty<a id="FNanchor_179_179" href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a>, so that their frequenters carried
away the smell with them. They possessed a definite
number of “chambers”, <i>Cellae</i><a id="FNanchor_180_180" href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a>, and above the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
door of each of these was inscribed the name of
the girl, that which she had adopted on her first
admission<a id="FNanchor_181_181" href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a>, and the price of her embraces<a id="FNanchor_182_182" href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a>. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
each “chamber” was to be found a bed (<i>pavimentum</i>,
cubiculum, pulvinar,—pavement, sleeping-place,
couch), which was spread with a particular kind of
coverlet, <i>lodix</i>, <i>lodicula</i>, (blanket, little blanket)<a id="FNanchor_183_183" href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a>,
and a lamp, <i>lucerna</i><a id="FNanchor_184_184" href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a>.</p>

<p>As for the brothel-keeper, the Romans seem to
have had no special word to express this; they use
in fact <i>leno</i> in this signification, though the word
properly means the Procurer who merely offers his
house for the purpose, but does not keep women,
giving them board and wage. Perhaps this arose
from the fact that in earlier times no regular brothels
existed in Rome; the women merely hired a lodging,
and the owner of the house had nothing at all to
do with their business, whilst the match-maker or
pandar confined <i>his</i> efforts to procuring girls for his
patrons and letting out his “chambers” for a fixed
charge <i>merces cellae</i> (hire of the chamber)<a id="FNanchor_185_185" href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a>, paid by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
each visitor. Only when the business became more
profitable, did Lenones or Lenae (Procurers, Procuresses),
for women also carried on Lenocinium
(procuration), actually keep girls, whom they bought,
as slaves<a id="FNanchor_186_186" href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">186</a>. The Leno had his <i>Villicus puellarum</i>
(Superintendent of the Maids), who assigned name
and price, provided the girls with clothes<a id="FNanchor_187_187" href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a>, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
kept a list of them and what they earned<a id="FNanchor_188_188" href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">188</a>. In fact
such of the women as were bond-servants were
obliged,—and this applied equally to those that were
not slaves,—to deliver up not merely the As for the
hire of the chamber, but the whole fee as well,
according to the amount fixed by the brothel-keeper
(Leno)<a id="FNanchor_189_189" href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a>, though much underhand trickery of various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
sorts occurred in connection with this regulation<a id="FNanchor_190_190" href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">190</a>.</p>

<p>The brothels were not allowed to be opened
before the ninth hour (four o’clock in the afternoon),
so as not to draw young men away from their
duties<a id="FNanchor_191_191" href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">191</a>. The girls either stood (Prostibula—women
who stand in front)<a id="FNanchor_192_192" href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> or sat (Proseda—women who
sit in front)<a id="FNanchor_193_193" href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> before the “chambers” or Lupan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>aria
(brothels), to call the passers-by to them. Did
a lover make his appearance, then the door of the
“chamber” was carefully fastened<a id="FNanchor_194_194" href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">194</a>, and “<i>occupata</i>”
(engaged) written over the door<a id="FNanchor_195_195" href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a>, an unoccupied
“chamber” being called <i>nuda</i> (naked)<a id="FNanchor_196_196" href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a>. Towards
morning the “chambers” were opened, and the
Leno (brothel-keeper) let the girls go<a id="FNanchor_197_197" href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a>. It would
seem to follow from this that these either did not
live in the brothel-keeper’s house at all, or that the
“chambers” were situated somewhere else, away
from head-quarters. From a passage in <i>Juvenal</i><a id="FNanchor_198_198" href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">198</a>
it has, perhaps wrongly, been concluded that these
“chambers” were at the Circus Maximus. Such
places are at any rate mentioned by <i>Dionysius of
Halicarnassus</i> as existing at the Portico above the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
shops<a id="FNanchor_199_199" href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">199</a>; and without doubt several passages are to
be found in Latin authors to prove that the women
plied their trade even after the close of the Representations<a id="FNanchor_200_200" href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">200</a>,
and we know that besides the regular
Ludi Circenses (Games of the Circus) other performances
of a similar kind were held in the Circus.</p>

<p>Besides the brothels, we find, particularly in the
Taverns (cauponae, tabernae—inns, taverns) and
Cookshops (popinae, ganea—cookshops, eating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>houses<a id="FNanchor_201_201" href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">201</a>,
women kept by the hosts for the gratification
of their patrons. As a rule these also were
bought slave-women, who served the guests, entertained
them with dance and music, and surrendered
their persons on desire. The hostesses themselves
devoted their attention to both trades, as e.g. is
shown by the “Copa” (Mine Hostess) ascribed to
<i>Virgil</i>; and hence they, and their husbands with
them, stood in the eye of the Magistrate on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
same footing with Lenones and Meretrices (Brothel-keepers
and Prostitutes)<a id="FNanchor_202_202" href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">202</a>.</p>

<p>Now who frequented these places? Down to the
time of the Empire only the lowest class of the
people, particularly Sailors<a id="FNanchor_203_203" href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">203</a>, Freedmen and Slaves<a id="FNanchor_204_204" href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">204</a>,
though indeed later, when <i>Claudius</i> and <i>Nero</i><a id="FNanchor_205_205" href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> set
so eminent an example, high and low equally might
be found both in brothels and in Taverns and
Cookshops. The bakers, envious of the profits made
by the inn-keepers, organized their tabernae (bread-stalls
or shops) in the mills in such a way that they
too could provide their customers with what they
wanted<a id="FNanchor_206_206" href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">206</a>. This appears to have been done first in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
Campania<a id="FNanchor_207_207" href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">207</a>. But not solely in regular Houses and
“Chambers” were “filles de joie” to be met with.
They carried on their trade also as <i>Scorta erratica</i>
(wandering whores, street-walkers) the commonest
sort, in all public places, at the corners of streets<a id="FNanchor_208_208" href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">208</a>,
round the tombs and monuments<a id="FNanchor_209_209" href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">209</a>, in out-of-the-way
nooks of the town and the surrounding plantations
in its neighbourhood<a id="FNanchor_210_210" href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">210</a>. In these places they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
carried on their trade, some no doubt on their own
account, other perhaps as slaves working for their
masters and mistresses and bound to deliver in a
fixed sum daily.</p>

<p>The different kinds of “filles de joye” so far
particularized were all of them slave-women, but
over and above these there were in Rome a large
number of Gay Women who carried on their profession
entirely on their own account, either merely as
a second string to their bow, like the Mimes, Dancers,
Harp-girls, Ambubaiae<a id="FNanchor_211_211" href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">211</a>, or else as sole aim and
object of their lives, in the character of <i>Scorta nobilia</i>
(noble whores) or <i>bonae meretrices</i> (good harlots) to
use <i>Plautus’</i> expressions. They were all of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
foreigners, and generally freed-women<a id="FNanchor_212_212" href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">212</a>, and were
distinguished not only for their more elaborate dress<a id="FNanchor_213_213" href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">213</a>,
but also on account of their education, which far and
away surpassed that of the Roman ladies. In this
respect however they fell short of the level reached
by the Greek hetaerae in the best times of Greece,
and for this reason never obtained the influence at
Rome on the life of the city and of the State which
the former possessed at Athens. They were not so
much friends (Amicae) as mistresses (Dominae) of
their Roman lover, and their relations with him
bodily only and not intellectual. For the rest this class
yet awaits a <i>Friedrich Jacobs</i> to be its historian. They
were either kept by an individual lover, or else gave
themselves only to rich admirers at their own private
lodgings,<a id="FNanchor_214_214" href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> that lay <i>perdu</i> far from the bustle of street
and market; but no doubt descended, when the time
of youth and beauty was over, to the condition of
common courtesans or even of mere street-walkers.</p>

<p>Just as happened in Greece, immodesty spread not a
little among the daughters and wives of the Roman
citizens also, and already in the reign of <i>Germanicus</i>,
<i>Tacitus</i> could report<a id="FNanchor_215_215" href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">215</a>:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span> “Eodem anno gravibus
senatus decretis libido feminarum coercita, cautumque
ne quaestum corpore faceret, cui avus
aut pater aut maritus Eques Romanus fuisset.”
(This same year severe decrees of the Senate
were passed to restrain unchastity on the part of
women, and it was forbidden for any to give her
person for hire, whose grandfather, father, or husband
had been a Roman knight). So it cannot cause any
great surprise to find <i>Martial</i><a id="FNanchor_216_216" href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> declaring:</p>

<p>
“Quaero diu totam, Sophroni Rufe, per urbem:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Si qua puella neget; nulla puella negat.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>(I have long been searching the city through,
Sophronius Rufus, if there is e’er a maid to say
no; there is not one!) To this result the introduction
at Rome of the worship of Isis had contributed not
a little<a id="FNanchor_217_217" href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">217</a>. Under pretence of serving Isis, the matrons
found an opportunity of wantoning unhindered in
the arms of paramours<a id="FNanchor_218_218" href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">218</a>, for the husbands dared
not enter the temple precincts while their wives offered
were performing their ten days’ devotion there.
Probably in cases of disease of the genitals Roman
women offered their prayers to Isis, as the men did
to Priapus, for the temples of the goddess were
full of images of parts of the body that had been
healed and of maimed organs<a id="FNanchor_219_219" href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">219</a>, and contained numer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>ous
establishments for the care of sick persons of
this particular character.</p>

<p>But of more influence than all the rest was the
example which the Emperors <i>Tiberius</i>, <i>Nero</i>, <i>Caligula</i>
and the infamous <i>Messalina</i><a id="FNanchor_220_220" href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> gave. Not contented
with the possession of a <i>Harem</i>, they set up actual
brothels in their palaces,—a practice the aristocracy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
soon copied, organizing similar establishments on
their estates, to be able to wallow indisturbed in
the mire of bestial lusts<a id="FNanchor_221_221" href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">221</a>.</p>

<p>Of vice as practised in the Baths and of male
whores in the brothels we shall speak later.</p>

<p>Now how were Brothels and Courtesans affected
in connection with the police of the State in Rome?
It has been shown already that no penalty whatever
attached either to illicit intercourse or to prostitution
in general, because the disgrace to individuals
involved in the commission of such offences in the
eyes of their fellows was thought sufficient to ensure
at any rate the daughters of citizens against unchastity.
But the case was different with married
women who were guilty of a breach of marriage
honour. Of the manifold punishments we will mention
only one here: the offender was imprisoned and
obliged to surrender her person to all comers, whilst
each time this took place a notification was given
by the ringing of a bell;—a procedure that continued
till finally abolished by the Emperor Theodosius<a id="FNanchor_222_222" href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">222</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

<p>They sought indeed to avoid the punishment by
declaring themselves engaged in Lenocinium (Procuration)
as a calling, or by joining the ranks of the
the actresses; but the Lex Papia included provisions
to put a stop to this irregularity<a id="FNanchor_223_223" href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">223</a>.</p>

<p><i>Lenocinium</i> (Procuration) in fact as well as the
<i>licentia stupri</i> (fornication permit) had to be notified
before the Aediles<a id="FNanchor_224_224" href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">224</a>, whose especial duty it was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
see that no Matron became a prostitute<a id="FNanchor_225_225" href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">225</a>. With
this object they were bound to frequently search
all such places as have been specified above (<i>loca
aedilem metuentia</i>—places that fear the aedile)<a id="FNanchor_226_226" href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">226</a>; but
dared not themselves indulge in any immorality
there<a id="FNanchor_227_227" href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">227</a>. When that pure-minded prince <i>Caligula</i>
became Emperor, he introduced the Whore-duty
(<i>vectigal ex capturis</i>—tax on prostitution-fees) as a
State impost<a id="FNanchor_228_228" href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">228</a>. This, <i>Alexander Severus</i> retained, it
is true, but assigned the revenue from it to the
maintenance of the public buildings, that it might
not contaminate the State Treasure.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span><a id="FNanchor_229_229" href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">229</a></p>

<p>The information here collected, imperfect as it
may be in many respects, is yet sufficient to throw
some light on the external relations of brothels and
courtesans. It shows convincingly that in the entire
absence of police supervision on the sanitary side,
such diseases as arose generally in Antiquity consequent
upon coition must have had their especial
home and chief focus in the brothels and their
denizens. But of what nature these diseases were,
and what parts of the body they attacked, we shall
only then be able to determine, when we come to
consider more precisely the actual excesses that
led to them, whether within or without the walls
of the brothels.</p>


<h3 id="Paederastia">Paederastia.</h3>


<h4>§ 12.</h4>

<p>In the preceding investigations we have shown
how the natural aim and object of coition, viz.
procreation of children, fell more and more into
the background, in order to make way for sensual
gratification; and we have made acquaintance with
the establishments that grew up in course of time
for its indulgence. The facility with which the
bestial instinct could be satisfied and the titillation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
of carnal pleasure procured, was bound to rob the
customary manner of sexual indulgence of the charm
of novelty, and to set the depraved imagination of
the voluptuary at work to solve the problem of how
to import manifold variations into the simple act
of copulation. This stage reached, it inevitably
followed that the natural ways of union of the
sexes began to appear insufficient, and the methods
of so-called <i>unnatural</i> Love (Venus illegitima) grew
up, wherein at last almost every trace of the specific
purpose of the genital organs was lost sight of.</p>

<p>The “figurae Veneris legitimae” (modes of natural
Love) are not altogether without interest for the
physician<a id="FNanchor_230_230" href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">230</a>, but their study is less necessary for our
particular purpose. The modes of “Venus illegitima”
(unnatural Love) are what concern us here. The
major part of these have unfortunately never been
included by writers on the history of Venereal disease
within the range of their enquiries. Hence it has
come about that while on the one hand they have
given quite false interpretations of various morbid
affections, they have on the other mistaken for the
names of diseases expressions signifying nothing more
than forms of the unnatural sensual indulgence alluded
to. The historical enquirer into these subjects must
indeed tread very slippery ground. Supposing him
to rise superior to the possible reproaches of morality,
fortified by the words of St. Paul<a id="FNanchor_231_231" href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">231</a>, still he can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
find absolutely nowhere in his investigations any
secure stopping-place, he must make up his mind
to dispense with all external help and to be thrown
utterly on his own resources. Not only do the best
and fullest Dictionaries of the Greek and Latin
languages leave him almost completely in the lurch,
but above and beyond this he has very often to
struggle with positive errors both in the Dictionaries
and on the part of the professional Philologists in
their annotations to the writings of the Ancients.
These mistakes he must first of all discover, and
afterwards correct. What such an undertaking involves,
what powers it demands, will be obvious to
anyone who is in any degree conversant with the
systematic study of Antiquity. Nevertheless the task
should not remain unattempted, if that is, we wish
ever to come to a clear understanding of the
relations of words and things in this connection;
and on this ground the following researches no less
than others find a legitimate place here. These we
offer as the best that the limitation of our powers
allowed,—at the same time gladly acknowledging
the no small assistance we have received from the
Treatises of Forberg and Meier<a id="FNanchor_232_232" href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">232</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span></p>

<p>Paederastia appears, as is the case with all sexual
perversions, to owe its origin to the stimulation of
the Asiatic climate, the mother of exuberance and
voluptuousness. The primary condition of its genesis
may be easily traced, if side by side with the dictum
of Forberg (loco citato, p. 235): “Et voluptas quidem
paediconis facile intelligitur, cum omnis voluptas
mentulae pendeat ex frictione” (And the pleasure
indeed of the sodomite is readily intelligible, since
all voluptuous pleasure depends on friction of the
penis), we take into consideration the fact that the
genital organs of Asiatic women,—a fact true also
of Italian and Spanish women<a id="FNanchor_233_233" href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">233</a>—like their whole
bodies, exhibit great looseness, and further note that
the “Sphincter ani”<a id="FNanchor_234_234" href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> muscle far and away surpasses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
the “Constrictor cunni” in strength. So it is by
no means improbable that the Apostle Paul is
accurate when he says<a id="FNanchor_235_235" href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">235</a>: “Wherefore God gave
them up in the lusts of their hearts unto uncleanness,
that their bodies should be dishonoured among
themselves; <i>for their women changed the natural use
into that which is against nature</i>: and likewise also
the men, leaving the natural use of the woman,
burned in their lust one toward another, men with
men working unseemliness.”</p>

<p>In Asia <i>natural</i> copulation formed a part of the
Temple service of Venus, and in course of time
Paederastia as well was joined with it, as is seen
from the following passage of St. Athanasius<a id="FNanchor_236_236" href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">236</a>:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
“Sane olim Phoeniciae mulieres in idolorum templis
prius prostabant, suique meretricii quaestus primordia
diis, qui illic colebantur, consecrabant, suam
deam stupris propitiam reddi, benevolamque hoc
pacto effici ratae. <em class="gesperrt">Viri quoque propriam
ementiti naturam, nec amplius mares
se esse patientes, in feminas se
converterunt, pergratum et honorificum
matri deorum se ita facturas
arbitrati.</em> Omnes denique una cum perditissimis
vivunt, et secum ipsi pugnant ut peiores quotidie
evadant, atque ut dixit sanctus Christi minister
Paulus:—(Here follows the passage just quoted from
the Epistle to the Romans.)—Haec autem et similia
agendo, fatentur certe et arguunt deos, quos ipsi colunt,
huiusmodi vitam duxisse, scilicet ex Jove puerorum
corruptiones atque adulteria, ex Venere meretriciam
vitam ... ex aliis alia didicere, quae quidem cum
leges puniunt, tum probi homines abhorrent.”</p>

<p>(Indeed the Phoenician women used in former
times to prostitute themselves for hire in the temples
of their idols and to offer up the gains of their
fornication as first-fruits to the deities that were
worshipped therein, deeming that in this way they
won the favour and goodwill of their goddess.
Moreover men, perverting their own proper nature,
and no more enduring to be males, turned themselves
into the likeness of women, supposing that
by so doing they rendered a service most grateful
and honourable to the Mother of the Gods. In
one word they all consort with the most abandoned
of mankind, and strive one with the other how
they may grow worse and worse day by day; and
as St. Paul the Apostle of Christ says:—(Here follows
the passage just quoted from the Epistle to the
Romans.)—By such and such-like acts they verily
confess and show forth that those gods that themselves
worship led lives of a like kind. Thus from
Jupiter they learned to seduce boys and to commit
adultery, from Venus harlotry, and so on from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
other gods other vile practices,—practices which are
at once punished by the laws and abominated by
every honourable man). The same passage explains
also how the Old Testament comes to designate
Cinaedi (on pathic Sodomites) by the expression
קָדֵשׁ (kadêsh, sanctus,—holy, consecrated). This
originally implied nothing more than a person who
devoted himself for the glory of a God as a servant
in his Temple; and we have good reason for believing
we can establish the conjecture that the whole cult
of the Priests of Cybelé, etc., who had to practice
emasculation and who were known by the name of
<i>Galli</i>, rests originally on a simple misunderstanding of
the expressions εὐνοῦχοι and ἀνδρόγυνοι (eunuchs,
men-women),—expressions which will be discussed
later on,—these words having meant at first nothing
more than <i>Cinaedi</i> (sodomites). It was only in later
times that Paederastia became a motive for Castration,
as by this means the body of the male could be
made to preserve for a longer period the youthful
boyishness that approximated it to the female form.
This is shown in the following passage of Lucian<a id="FNanchor_237_237" href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">237</a>,
a passage of special interest for the history of
Paederastia:</p>

<p>“So at first when men still lived the old heroic
life and reverenced virtue that brought them nearer
the gods, they obeyed the laws that nature had
laid down and marrying in due proportion of age
became the fathers of noble children. But little
by little the age degenerated from that high level<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
to the pit of sensual indulgence, and struck out
new and abnormal modes of gratification. Soon
a reckless licentiousness broke the very laws of
nature; and for the first time a lover looked on a
<i>man</i> as on a woman to lust after him, and worked
his wicked will either by superior force or by dint
of artful persuasions. So in one bed came together
one and the same sex. And each seeing himself
in the other, took no shame in anything they did or
in anything they suffered to be done. Wasting their
seed on barren<a id="FNanchor_238_238" href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> rocks, as the saying goes, they
bought a brief pleasure at the cost of deepest
infamy. Indeed with some to such a height of
overmastering force did their reckless passion rise
that they actually violated nature with the knife;
and only when they had emptied men of their
manliness did they attain the summit and acmé of
their gratification.</p>

<p>“But the wretched and unhappy creatures, that
they may remain longer boys, suffer themselves to
be no more men,—an ambiguous riddle midway
between the sexes, neither preserving the sex they
were born to, nor yet having any other to belong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
to. The bloom that was kept a while in youth
withers in old age and makes them wither with it
in premature decay. At one moment they are
counted as boys, then lo! they are old men; there
is no middle time of manhood between the two.
Thus wanton luxury, the foul mother of every evil
thing, contriving shameful pleasures one to cap the
other, fell into the slough of that <i>disease</i> that cannot
even be named with decency, (μέχρι τῆς οὐ
ῥηθῆναι δυναμένης εὐπρεπῶς νόσου) that no
province of impurity might remain unexplored.”</p>

<p>In later times indeed castration was resorted to
after the attainment of man’s estate, in order that
the Eunuchs might be able to appease the titillation of
sensual desire in the women without fear of impregnating
them<a id="FNanchor_239_239" href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">239</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<p>In Syria, where this vicious practice of paederastia
was especially in vogue, the Jews also appear to
have been acquainted with it<a id="FNanchor_240_240" href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">240</a>. From Asia, whether
through the instrumentality of the Phoenicians, or
as <i>Welcker</i><a id="FNanchor_241_241" href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> maintains, through that of the Lydians,
Paederastia came in the first instance to Crete, and
spread from thence over the whole of Greece<a id="FNanchor_242_242" href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">242</a>.</p>

<p>Just as was the case with the cult of Venus in
that country, so the “love of boys” assumed quite
a different form in Greece. As <i>Paedophilia</i> (Affection
for boys) it took rank as one of the means of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
education, being consecrate to the heavenly Eros,
while Paederastia (Carnal love of boys) fell to the
province of the common Eros. Down to quite
modern times Paedophilia has been confounded with
Paederastia, and in this way a shameful stigma
attached to the Greek <i>nation</i>,—a stigma that <i>Meier</i>,
following the initiative of <i>Jacobs</i> and <i>K. O. Müller</i>
(loco citato), was the first to free the Greeks from.
Granted, the two things approached very near each
other; still <i>Paederastia was never approved by the
Greeks</i><a id="FNanchor_243_243" href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">243</a>. At Sparta the violation of boys was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
punished by loss of civil rights, exile or death<a id="FNanchor_244_244" href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">244</a>,
and it was the same at Athens, as <i>Meier</i> (loco
citato) pp. 167 sqq. has sufficiently proved. The
fact that the laws relating to this offence were
promulgated at Athens only after the time of <i>Solon</i>
shows that paederastia, as well as brothels, did not
come into use there till about that time. True
Athens in later times was quite as notorious for
the prevalence there of paederastia as Corinth was
for its Gay Women<a id="FNanchor_245_245" href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">245</a>; and Aristophanes’ Comedies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
show only too abundantly how much occasion he
could find for scourging the “Pathics”, and how
the Gymnasia and Palaestrae (Wrestling-grounds)
also were responsible for a great deal of the harm
done.</p>

<p>For, as Aristophanes<a id="FNanchor_246_246" href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">ἐν παιδοτρίβου δὲ καθίζοντας, τὸν μηρὸν ἔδει προβαλέσθαι</div>
  <div class="verse">τοὺς παῖδας, ὅπως τοῖς ἔξωθεν μηδὲν δείξειαν  ἀπηνές.</div>
  <div class="verse">εἶτ’ αὖ πάλιν αὖθις ἀνισταμένους ξυμψῆσαι, καὶ προνοῆσαι</div>
  <div class="verse">εἴδωλον τοῖσιν ἐρασταῖσιν τῆς ἥβης μὴ καταλείπειν.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(Of old when boys sat at the trainer’s, they were
bound to throw out the thigh, so as not to expose
to the spectators’ gaze anything unbecoming; then
again when they got up again, they had to scrape
out the mark in the sand, and take care not to
leave behind a model of their youthful shape,—an
incitement to lovers).</p>

<p>Besides the Gymnasia and Palaestrae, the barbe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>r’s
shops (κουρεῖα)<a id="FNanchor_247_247" href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">247</a>, perfumers’ shops (μυροπωλεῖα)<a id="FNanchor_248_248" href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">248</a>,
Surgeries (ἰατρεῖα)<a id="FNanchor_249_249" href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">249</a>, Money-changers’ counters
(τράπεζαι)<a id="FNanchor_250_250" href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">250</a>, bath-houses<a id="FNanchor_251_251" href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">251</a>, and to a greater or
less extent all kinds of workshops (ἐργαστήρια)<a id="FNanchor_252_252" href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">252</a>,
particularly when in situations handy to the Market,
served as trysting-places of the paederasts and pathics.
Here the former sought victims for their vicious
desires, and the latter opportunities to sell their
persons; while many of the proprietors of such
places may well have acted as Procurers (προαγωγοί,
μαστροποί,—Procurers, Pandars) for this purpose.
The vice itself was chiefly practised in lonely,
obscure parts of the town, and particularly on the
Pnyx hill<a id="FNanchor_253_253" href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">253</a>.</p>

<p>The Eleans and Bœotians are not only reproached
with paederastia, but the violation of boys is alleged
to have been <i>allowed</i> among these peoples<a id="FNanchor_254_254" href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">254</a>. Megara<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
it is true is charged with ὕβρις (shameful violence),
a common designation for paederastia<a id="FNanchor_255_255" href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">255</a>, but we may
certainly doubt whether the temple of Ἀφροδίτη
πρᾶξις there, which <i>Pausanias</i><a id="FNanchor_256_256" href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">256</a>, mentions, had anything
to do with this vice. The author in question
says: “After the sanctuary of Dionysus is shown
a temple of Venus. The image of Venus is of
ivory, and is called Aphrodité <i>Praxis</i>. It is the
most ancient image in the temple.” No other
author however mentions any such cult as existing
in Megara, and even though the word πρᾶξις (intercourse),
as <i>Meier</i> (loco citato p. 153, note 49) has
shown by examples, is used specially of paederastia,
yet at the same time the passage of <i>Euripides</i>, Ion 894.</p>

<p>(Thou, god, partner of my bed, didst lead me,

proves that πράσσειν (to do, to have intercourse)

little above paederastia is called χάρις ἄχαρις (a
grace that is without grace) and further down Ἔρως,
Ἀφροδίτης μὴ παρούσης,—Ἔρως χωρὶς Ἀφροδίτης,
(Love—Eros—where Aphrodité is not, Love without
Aphrodité); so how can it have been regarded by
the Greeks as under the <i>patronage</i> of Venus? Undoubtedly
πρᾶξις is here synonymous with πόρνη
(harlot), and the Ἀφροδίτη πρᾶξις at Megara is
nothing else than the Ἀφροδίτη πόρνη of other cities.</p>

<p><i>Chalcis</i> had gained such notoriety for paederastia<a id="FNanchor_258_258" href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">258</a>,
that χαλκιδίζειν (to act the Chalcidian) was said
proverbially for παιδεραστεῖν (to practise paederastia).
It was the same with <i>Chios</i> and <i>Siphnos</i>,
as the expressions χιάζειν and σιφνιάζειν (to play
the Chian, the Siphnian) in <i>Hesychius</i> prove. Hesychius
says indeed <em class="gesperrt">σιφνιάζειν</em>: i.e. to finger
behind; for the Siphnians are ill-spoken of as enjoying
boy-lovers. To act the Siphnian then means, to
poke with the finger. But the first explanation by
καταδακτυλίζειν (to finger behind), as well as the
gloss of <i>Suidas</i><a id="FNanchor_259_259" href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">259</a>, show clearly that the inhabitants
of the island of Siphnos,—one of the Cyclades,
practised a species, if we may use the expression,
of <i>Onania postica</i> (back-door, posterior masturbation),—like
the cobbler at Vienna, who to allay the
Prurigo ani (itching of the anus) pushed his hammer
up his posterior, and then alas! could not pull it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
out again. In the same way the Siphnians used
the fingers<a id="FNanchor_260_260" href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">260</a>.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Italy were according to <i>Suidas</i>
(under the name Θάμυρις—Thamyris) inventors of
paederastia; and Etruscans, Samnites and Messapians,
as well as the Greeks dwelling in Magna Graecia,
lay under the reproach of practising the most vicious
forms of love with men and violation of boys<a id="FNanchor_261_261" href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">261</a>.
In all probability the vice spread from here to Rome,
where it is found as early as the year 433 A.U.C.<a id="FNanchor_262_262" href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">262</a>.
To such an extent did it increase that in 585 A.U.C.
(B.C. 169), as <i>Meier</i> has demonstrated, the <i>Lex
Scantinia</i> had to be passed against it. Yet all this
amounted as yet to nothing in comparison with
the scenes of horror that were enacted under the
Emperors <i>Tiberius</i>, <i>Caligula</i>, etc., of whom <i>Martial</i><a id="FNanchor_263_263" href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">263</a>
says:</p>

stock in trade, that the baby-boy torn from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
the breast might solicit a sordid wage by his wailing,
and immature bodies paid horrible penalties.
Horrors such as these the great Father of Italy
(Domitian) would not suffer: that same good Emperor
who of late came to the rescue of tender youths,
that raging lust might not make men unfruitful.
Heretofore boys loved him,—and young men and
old; now the very infants too love thee, Caesar).</p>

<h3>Diseases consequent on Paederastia.</h3>


<h4>§ 13.</h4>

<p>If we consider, first that the contractile power of
the <i>Sphincter ani</i> muscle offered great resistance to
the paederast, a resistance only to be overcome by
the exertion of considerable force, secondly that the
glands of the <i>rectum</i> exude a malodorous secretion,
which under the influence of climate,—a subject to
be dealt with more precisely later on,—assumes a
more or less acrid quality, it will not surprise us to
find that manifold forms of disease showed themselves
in Ancient times both among paederasts and
cinaedi (pathics). These were no doubt all the more
serious in cases where the one set of organs or the
other was already morbidly affected. As to the
paederast indeed the direct evidence is scanty, yet
it is not entirely wanting, as may be seen from the
following Epigram of <i>Martial</i><a id="FNanchor_265_265" href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">265</a>:</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">In Naevolum.</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse"><em class="gesperrt">Mentula cum doleat puero, tibi</em>, Naevole, <em class="gesperrt">culus</em>,</div>
  <div class="verse indent4">Non sum divinus, sed scio quid facias.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<p>(To Naevolus.—When I see <i>pained and sore the
boy’s penis and your posterior</i>, Naevolus,—I’m no
wizard, but I know what it is you do). Here we
see both parts suffering from disease, the paederast
in his penis, the pathic in his posterior: and <i>Martial</i>
concludes Naevolus was a <i>cinaedus</i>.</p>

<p>But more especially must phimosis and paraphimosis
have had a tendency to be set up in the
case of the paederast. These at first, because the
continuous state of erection of the <i>penis</i> which is a
feature of these affections was obviously the most
visibly conspicuous symptom, were designated by
the name Satyriasis, the usual appellation of the
latter condition. This will also give a probable
explanation of the mortality from this cause observed
by <i>Themison</i> in <i>Crete</i><a id="FNanchor_266_266" href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">266</a>,—a locality notorious, as we
have seen, for the dishonouring of boys,—and
generally for the frequency of Satyriasis, which often
took an almost epidemic character in that island.
Paraphimosis it should be noted in passing had
already been only too frequently noted as affecting
masturbators. Physicians indeed say nothing as to
the predisposing causes, and explain the disease as
arising from an <i>Acrimonia humorum</i> (Acridness of
the humours) or from drinking a Philtre (Love-potion).
<i>Naumann</i><a id="FNanchor_267_267" href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> appears to wish to make the
Satyriasis that prevailed in Crete some form of
leprous affection, but for this view we can find
absolutely no ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>

<p>Much more frequent mention is found of affections
of the <i>rectum</i> among the pathics as consequences
of paederastia. First come fissures, and in their
train ulcers of the <i>rectum</i>; whence the expressions
<i>sectus</i>, <i>percisus</i> (cut), and the like are applied so
often in Roman writers to the pathic, and to his
vice generally. So <i>Martial</i><a id="FNanchor_268_268" href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> says:</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">In Carinum.</span></p>

  <div class="verse">Culum non habet, est tamen cinaedus.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(To Carinus. —Carinus has no relics left of <i>his
fundament, cut up to the very navel</i>; and yet he
itches with desire up to the very navel. Oh! what
a vile itch torments the unhappy man! He possesses
no posterior, and nevertheless is a cinaedus (pathic).)</p>

poor lady, play the paederast with you. You

think, Lesbia, you’d better not get up, nor yet sit

<p>Usually indeed the Pathic tried to conceal his
complaint, and to make it pass under some other
name, as does Charisianus:</p>

of paederastia.</p>

<p>(To Caecilianus.—When I have said <i>ficus</i>, you

solecism, and declare <i>ficos</i> should be the word. We
will say <i>ficus</i>, meaning the figs that we know grow
on the tree, but your figs, Caecilianus, we will
call <i>ficos</i>).</p>

<p>Now too we shall understand the <i>medico ridente</i>
(the doctor grinning) in the following passage of
<i>Juvenal</i> (II. 12):</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent6">Sed podice laevi</div>
  <div class="verse">Caeduntur <em class="gesperrt">tumidae</em>, medico ridente, <em class="gesperrt">mariscae</em>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(But from your smooth posterior are cut, the
doctor grinning the while, <i>the bloated swellings</i>).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
Just as it admits of no doubt that in the passage
of <i>Horace</i><a id="FNanchor_274_274" href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">274</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Nam, displosa sonat quantum vesica, pepedi</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Diffissa nate <em class="gesperrt">ficos</em>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(For as loud as a burst bladder sounds, I farted
my swellings (ficos—figs) away, splitting the rump),
<i>ficos</i> and not as commonly <i>ficus</i> must be read.</p>

<p>That these morbid growths were not entirely free
from contagious matter seems to be indicated by
the following passages. In the <i>Priapeia</i> (Carm. 50)
we read:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Quaedam, si placet hoc tibi, Priape,</div>
  <div class="verse">Ficosissima me puella ludit,</div>
  <div class="verse">Et non dat mihi, nec negat daturam;</div>
  <div class="verse">Causasque invenit usque differendi.</div>
  <div class="verse">Quae si contigerit fruenda nobis,</div>
  <div class="verse">Totam cum paribus, Priape, nostris</div>
  <div class="verse">Cingemus tibi mentulam coronis.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(A certain girl, if it please you to listen, Priapus,
is playing with me. Most sorely afflicted is she
with swellings; and she will not give herself to me,
yet does not say she never will, and ever finds
excuses for putting off and putting off. Now if
ever she shall be mine to enjoy, I and my comrades
with me, will wreath all thy <i>penis</i>, Priapus, with
garlands). The girl, who was badly affected with
these swellings, and that presumably in the secret
parts, refuses her lover coition. The latter does not
insist, but prays to Priapus, as was habitually done
in all cases of affections of the genitals (see p. 74
above) and vows to deck his penis with garlands.
It follows that the lover was aware these swellings
would be injurious to him, if he should constrain
the girl, of whom the poet says, <i>nec negat daturam</i>
(yet does not say she will <i>not</i> give herself), to lie
with him. Still clearer evidence of this may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
found in the following Epigram of <i>Martial</i>, where
a whole family is affected with these swellings or
tumours:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent6">De familia ficosa.<a id="FNanchor_275_275" href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">275</a></div>

  <div class="verse">Cum sint ficosi pariter iuvenesque senesque,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Res mira est, ficus non habet unus ager.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(On a tumourous household.—The goodwife is
tumourous, tumourous the goodman her husband,
tumourous the daughter of the house, and the son-in-law
and the grandson. Neither house-steward
nor factor is free of the foul ulcer, nor the rugged
ditcher, nor yet the ploughman. Now when all
alike, young and old have tumours (ficos, ficus), the
strange thing is, not a single field has fig-trees
(ficus)). For the rest the words <i>ulcere turpi</i> (foul
ulcer) show that <i>ficus</i>, like σύκος and σύκωσις (fig,
fig-like swelling) in Greek, signifies not only a fig-shaped
swelling, but also an ulcer with granulous
surface, like a fig cut in two. Or possibly it would
be better to understand here swellings that have
passed into the ulcerated stage<a id="FNanchor_276_276" href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">276</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>

<p>Seeing how plainly the passages just quoted from
non-medical Writers point to these swellings being
a consequence of paederastia, it is surprising that
not one of the Ancient physicians, spite of <i>Juvenal’s
medico ridente</i> (the doctor grinning the while), ever
so far as we know, alleges this form of licentiousness
as cause of affections of the sort. On the other
hand we cannot help remarking that the frequency
of these swellings in the time of <i>Martial</i> and <i>Juvenal</i>
can hardly be explained as arising solely from the
general prevalence of paederastia. More probably,
then as now, the <i>Genius epidemicus</i> (Epidemic influences)
bore no unimportant share in bringing
about the result, just as was the case (see later)
with <i>Mentagra</i> (Eruption of the chin).</p>

<p>However not merely primary affections of the
posteriors were the punishment of the <i>Cinaedus</i>, but
also secondary ones of the <i>mouth</i> and <i>throat</i>. First
and foremost was hoarseness of the voice, to which
<i>Martial</i><a id="FNanchor_277_277" href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> alludes, when he makes the champion of
the baths the <i>cinaedus</i> Charinus speak <i>raucidulo ore</i>
(with a weak, hoarse voice). This we find, following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
Reiske’s<a id="FNanchor_278_278" href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> indication, more explicitly dealt with in
<i>Dio Chrysostom</i><a id="FNanchor_279_279" href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">279</a>:—</p>

<p>“But this is surely worth mentioning, and it is a
thing no one can deny. I mean the noteworthy
fact that a disease has attacked so many in this
city,—one which I used to hear of as prevailing
much more frequently with others than amongst
you. What is it I mean? Even though I could
explain myself no more clearly, yet you might easily
guess the answer. Do not think I am speaking of
secrets, of hidden doings, when the astounding fact
itself speaks plainly enough. For there are many
in this city that are asleep, even while they walk
and stand and speak; though they may appear to
most observers to be awake, yet it is not really so.</p>

<p>“Now they give, in my opinion, the clearest proof
that they are asleep,—they snore (ῥέγχουσιν). I
cannot, by heaven, express myself more clearly
with decency. True only a few of the sleepers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
are suffering from the complaint I mean, and of
the others it affects only the drunken, the overfed
and such as have lain ill. But I maintain this
vicious practice (ἔργον) shames the city and brands
it publicly. The grossest ignominy is brought down
upon their native city by these sleepers by day,
and they ought, I say, to have been expelled
your borders, as has been their fate everywhere
else. For it is not now and then, nor here and
there, they are met with; but at all times and in
all places in the city occasion may be found to
threaten, scorn or deride them. For the rest the
practice has actually penetrated now to boys still
young, and adults that yet would fain be reputable,
suffer themselves to be led away into regarding
the matter as a trifle, and if they refrain from the
decisive step, yet it was their wish to take it.</p>

<p>“If there were a city in which wailing were to
be heard all day long, and no one could walk
about in it, no! not one minute, without listening
to the sound of lamentation, tell me, what man
would willingly stay here? Now wailing, as all
agree, is a sign of unhappiness; but that other sound
is the sign of shamelessness and lewdness the most
scandalous. Surely one would much rather choose
to associate with unhappy men than with paederasts<a id="FNanchor_280_280" href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">280</a>.
I might avoid listening, if a single man
were to be blowing the flute everlastingly, but if
in a particular place there is an everlasting noise
of flutes, singing or guitar-playing,—such as might
be where the rocks ever ring with the Syrens’
song,—I could not, having arrived there, endure
to remain. And this unmusical and harsh tone
of voice<a id="FNanchor_281_281" href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">281</a>, what man of any virtue can abide it?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
If a man passes in front of a home in which he
catches the sound, he says, “Of a surety there
is a brothel there!” Now what shall be said of
a city where nothing <i>but</i> this tone of voice prevails
universally, so that no exception can be made of
time or day or place whatever? For in streets
and houses, in public places, in the theatre and
in the Gymnasium, <i>paederastia</i> is rife<a id="FNanchor_282_282" href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">282</a>.</p>

<p>“Again I have never yet heard a flute-player of
a morning in the city, but this horrible sort of din
is raised<a id="FNanchor_283_283" href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> from earliest dawn.</p>

<p>“I do not indeed shut my eyes to the fact that
it will be said I am talking silly nonsense most likely,
in making such allegations, and that there is nothing
in it. Nay! but surely you are only carrying pot-herbs
in your cart, and behold with indifference
profusion of white bread on the road, as well as
salt and fresh meat. But just consider the thing
(πρᾶγμα i. e. paederastia) in this way too: If any
one of these objectors should come into a city,
where all men, when they point to a thing, point
at it with the middle finger<a id="FNanchor_284_284" href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">284</a>, when any one gives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
the right hand, gives it with this same gesture,
and when he stretches out the hand, as the people
does in voting or the judges in giving decisions,
does so in the same way, what, pray will he think
of such a city? What, if further all men walk in
this city with skirts up-raised, as if wading in a
quagmire? For do you not really and truly know
what has given occasion to the defamation you
suffer; what it is has offered matter to such as
are unfriendly disposed to you for censure on
our city? Tell me, what is the reason they
nickname you “hawks” (κερκίδες)<a id="FNanchor_285_285" href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">285</a>?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>

<p>“Well, but you opine the question is not what
others say of you, but what you really do yourselves?
Good; but if a single disease of such a
sort attacks a people that they all of them acquire
women’s voices, and no man, neither stripling nor
grey-beard, can utter a word in a man’s voice, is
not this a horrible thing, and harder to bear, I
should suppose, than any Plague? For it is not
<i>shameful</i> to have a fever, nor even to die.</p>

<p>“Nay! but to speak with women’s voice is after
all to speak with human voice, and no one is
filled with aversion when he hears a woman. But,
tell me, whose is this voice; does it not belong
to the <i>Androgyni</i> (men-women), the Cinaedi? or
to such as have had the genitals amputated? True
it is not invariably found with all such, but it is
characteristic of them and a sign of what they are.</p>

<p>“Well then! suppose a stranger from a distance
to judge from your voices, what kind of men you
are, and what are your pursuits (πράττειν,—what
it is you do). You are not fit, I tell you, to be
neatherds or shepherds. I wonder would any one
take you for descendants of the Argives, as you
profess to be, or indeed for Greeks at all,—you
who outdo the Phoenicians in lubricity? At any
rate I do think it would behove a man of any
morality in such a city to close his ears with wax
far more than if he were sailing past the Syrens’
shore. There he would run the risk of death, but
here of foulest licence, of violation, of the vilest
seduction.</p>

<p>“Once Ionic harmony was in vogue, or Doric,
or yet another sort, the Phrygian and Lydian,
now it is the music of Aradus and the Phoenician
modes that please you; you love this rhythm <span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
<i>par excellence</i>, as others do the Spondaic. Was ever
a race of men that were good musicianers—through
the nose?!</p>

<p>(p. 409). “But such a rhythm must needs have
something to follow. You would seem not to
know what; just as with other nations the wrath
of the gods overtook some single part, the hands,
the feet or the face<a id="FNanchor_286_286" href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">286</a>, in the same way among
you an endemic disease has attacked the nose.
Just as the angry Aphrodité they say made the
Lemnian women’s armpits abominable, know now that
the gods in their anger have played havoc with the
noses of most of your fellow citizens, and that
is why they have this characteristic voice of their
own. Indeed from where else could it have come?</p>

<p>“But <i>I</i> say this thing is the mark of most
infamous lewdness, of most infamous madness, of
contempt for all decency (all morality), and (a
proof) of the fact that there is no more any single
thing held to be disgraceful. Their speech, their
gait, their look, proclaim it.”</p>

<p>From this passage of Dio Chrysostom, who lived
at the end of the First and beginning of the Second
Century A.D., we see that at that period the vice
of paederastia prevailed at Tarsus to an appalling
extent; and very possibly it is this circumstance
that gave occasion to the declaration of the Apostle
St. Paul<a id="FNanchor_287_287" href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">287</a>, whose native town of course Tarsus was,
when he says:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span></p>
<p>“Wherefore God gave them up in the lusts of
their hearts unto uncleanness, that their bodies
should be dishonoured among themselves....
For their women<a id="FNanchor_288_288" href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> changed the natural use into
that which is against nature; and likewise also
the men, leaving the natural use of the woman,
burned in their lust one toward another, men
with men working unseemliness, and receiving in
themselves that recompense of their error which
was due.” This recompense was no doubt the
ῥέγχειν (snoring), which according to <i>Reiske</i> was
the consequence of an affection of the throat and
nose in which the breath was exhaled with a
characteristic noise. To corroborate this view he
quotes in his edition of Dio Chrysostom the following
passage from <i>Ammianus Marcellinus</i><a id="FNanchor_289_289" href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">289</a>, who picturing
the habits of the Romans in the middle of the
Fourth Century, wrote thus: “Haec nobilium instituta.
Ex turba vero imae sortis et pauperrimae, in tabernis
aliqui pernoctant vinariis: nonnulli velabris umbraculorum
theatralium latent, quae Campanam imitatus
lasciviam Catulus in aedilitate sua suspendit omnium
primus; aut pugnaciter aleis certant, <em class="gesperrt">turpi sono
fragosis naribus introrsum reducto
spiritu concrepantes</em>.” (Such are the
usages of the nobles. But of the masses, those of
lowest and poorest lot, certain spend the night in
wine-taverns, some lurk under the curtains of the
theatre awnings,—which Catulus in his aedileship,
imitating Campanian luxury, was the very first to
erect; or quarrel and fight at dice, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
<i>making an ugly rattling sound the while by drawing in the breath
through their rough nostrils</i>).</p>

<p>Now we know that paederasts had foul breaths,
as <i>Martial</i><a id="FNanchor_290_290" href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> indeed noted, consequently the mucous
membrane of the mouth was morbidly affected in
its action, and further that they spoke <i>raucidulo ore</i>
(with hoarse voice)<a id="FNanchor_291_291" href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">291</a>, which must have been with
many the ordinary consequence of a thickening of
the tissues by previous ulceration; and at this fact
this Speech of Dio Chrysostom, as <i>Reiske</i> understands
it, may very well hint. But to take the main gist
of his speech, the author of the “Tarsica” signifies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
by ῥέγχειν (to snort) something quite different from
this, as the whole context shows clearly.</p>

<p>It was in fact a signal or mode of solicitation, by which
the pathics sought to allure the paederasts to them and
invited them to lewdness, as comes out more plainly
in the following passage of <i>Clemens Alexandrinus</i><a id="FNanchor_292_292" href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">292</a>:
Αἱ δὲ <em class="gesperrt">ἀνδρογύνων συνουσίαις</em> ἥδονται·
παρεισῥέουσιν δὲ ἔνδον κιναίδων ὄχλοι, ἀθυρόγλωσσοι·
μιαροὶ μὲν τὰ σώματα, μιαροὶ δὲ τὰ
φθέγματα, εἰς ὑπουργίας ἀκολάστους ἠνδρωμένοι,
μοιχείας διάκονοι, κιχλίζοντες καὶ ψιθυρίζοντες,
καὶ <em class="gesperrt">τὸ πορνικὸν ἀναίδην εἰς ἀσέλγειαν
διὰ ῥινῶν ἐπιψοφοῦντες ἐπικιναίδισμα</em>,
ἀκολάστοις ῥήμασι καὶ σχήμασι τέρπειν πειρώμενοι,
καὶ εἰς γέλωτας ἐκκαλούμενοι, πορνείας
παράδρομον· ἔστι δ’ὅτε καὶ ὑπεκκαιόμενοι διὰ
τὴν τυχοῦσαν ὄργην, ἤτοι πόρνοι αὐτοὶ ἢ καὶ
κιναίδων ὄχλον εἰς ὄλεθρον ἐζηλωκότες, <em class="gesperrt">ἐπικροτοῦσι
τῇ ῥινὶ</em>, βατράχων δίκην, καθάπερ ἔνοικον
τοῖς μυκτῆρσι τὴν χολὴν κεκτημένοι. (But they
delight in the <i>assemblies of the Androgyni</i> (men-women);
and crowds of pathics hurry along to
join them within, everlasting chatterers, abominable
in person and abominable in voice; reared up to
manhood for unchaste ministrations, servants of
adultery; tittering and whispering, and <i>sounding
though their nose the debauched cinaedus’ call to
shameful licentiousness</i>, striving to please with indecent
words and gestures, and challenging to laughter, a
race and competition in harlotry. Then again at
times kindled by some chance gust of anger, whether
debauchees themselves or roused to a fatal emulation
with the crowd of pathics, they make a rattling
sound with the nose, like frogs, as though they
kept their stock of gall up their nostrils).</p>

<p>But possibly the Tarsians were also <i>Fellatores</i>
(ii qui penem alienum in os admittunt, ibique eo
sugunt ut voluptas quaedam libidinosa paretur,—those
who allow another’s penis to be put in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
mouth, and suck it) (see later), and snorted as
<i>fellatores</i> did at their task,—for the word ῥέγχειν
(to snort) is manifestly used in several different
senses. It only remains to mention that a <i>pale
complexion</i> was also reckoned one of the signs of
a <i>Cinaedus</i>, a fact to which <i>Juvenal’s</i> (II. 50.) words
refer: <i>Hippo subit iuvenes et morbo pallet utroque</i>.
(Hippo submits to men, and is pale with two-fold
disease). Of these marks of the <i>Cinaedus</i> we shall
speak in greater detail directly.</p>


<h3><a name="Feminine_Disease" id="Feminine_Disease"></a>Νοῦσος Θήλεια (<b>Feminine Disease</b>)<a id="FNanchor_293_293" href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">293</a>.</h3>


<h4>§ 14.</h4>

<p>The passage of <i>Dio Chrysostom</i> discussed in the
preceding section brings us, in virtue of a variety
of hints it contains, to the much canvassed Νοῦσος Θήλεια (feminine disease) of the Scythians. <i>Stark</i>
has collected with the greatest care everything that
has so far been adduced by different authors in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
explanation of the subject; and on his Work we must
base our own efforts in the investigations that follow.</p>

<p><i>Herodotus</i><a id="FNanchor_294_294" href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> relates how the Scythians had made
themselves masters of all Asia, and how some of
them on their homeward march had plundered the
very ancient temple of <i>Venus Urania</i> at Ascalon, a
town of Syria; and then proceeds as follows:</p>

<p>“On such of the Scythians as plundered the
temple at Ascalon, and on their posterity for successive
generations, the goddess inflicted the
θήλεια νούσος—feminine disease. And the Scythians
say themselves it is for this cause they
suffer the sickness, and moreover that any who
visit the Scythian country may see among them
what is the condition of those whom the Scythians
call Ἐναρέες”. (a Scythian word, probably having the
same meaning as Greek ἀνδρόγυνοι—men-women).</p>

<p>The different views that have been formulated at
different times as to the nature of the νοῦσος θήλεια
may be readily classified as follows. It was regarded
as:—</p>

<p>1. <i>a Vice</i>, this vice being,</p>

<p>a) <i>Paederastia</i>; manifestly the oldest explanation,—already
alluded to by <i>Longinus</i>, but specially
championed by <i>Bouhier</i><a id="FNanchor_295_295" href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">295</a>, also entertained by the
interpreters of <i>Longinus</i>, <i>Toll</i> and <i>Pearce</i>, as well as
by <i>Casaubon</i> (Epistolae) and <i>Costar</i><a id="FNanchor_296_296" href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">296</a>;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span></p>

<p>b). Onanism (Self Masturbation),—a view <i>Sprengel</i><a id="FNanchor_297_297" href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">297</a>
is inclined to decide in favour of.</p>

<p>2. <i>a bodily Disease</i>,—to wit,</p>

<p>a). <i>Haemorrhoids</i> (Piles); an opinion maintained
by <i>Paul Thomas de Girac</i><a id="FNanchor_298_298" href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">298</a>, <i>Valckenaar</i> in his Notes
to Herodotus, <i>Bayer</i><a id="FNanchor_299_299" href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">299</a>, and the authors of the
“General History of the World”<a id="FNanchor_300_300" href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">300</a>;</p>

<p>b). <i>actual Menstruation</i>, for which <i>le Fèvre</i> and
<i>Dacier</i> would seem to have declared;</p>

<p>c). <i>Gonorrhoea</i> (Clap), which <i>Patin</i><a id="FNanchor_301_301" href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">301</a>, <i>Hensler</i><a id="FNanchor_302_302" href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">302</a>
and <i>Degen</i><a id="FNanchor_303_303" href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> understood to be meant;</p>

<p>d). <i>actual loss of the Testicles, true Eunuchs, Mercurialis</i><a id="FNanchor_304_304" href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">304</a>
considered must have been implied; and
with this view <i>Stark’s</i> conclusion in part coincides,
who understood a disease involving complete loss
of virile power, both corporeal and mental, and
producing an actual metamorphosis of the male type
into the female.</p>

<p>(3). <i>a mental Disease</i>, in fact a form of Melancholia.
This is the view adopted by <i>Sauvages</i><a id="FNanchor_305_305" href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">305</a>,
<i>Heyne</i>, <i>Bose</i>, <i>Koray</i><a id="FNanchor_306_306" href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> and <i>Friedreich</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

<p>It would naturally be our task to examine the
reasons alleged for and against these separate views.
Supposing however we succeed in satisfactorily
proving one of them to be the right one, then
<i>ipso facto</i> all the rest come to nothing; and so we
propose here to essay the advocacy of the oldest
of them,—the view that makes the νοῦσος θήλεια
to be the vice of paederastia. <i>En passant</i> we must
call attention to the fact that under the name of
paederastia must be understood not only the vicious
habit of the paederast pure and simple, of the man
that is who <i>practices</i> the act, but also of the <i>pathic</i>,
who offers opportunities for its commission. This
is a point which above all others has been quite
left out of sight by the adversaries of the view in
question.</p>

<p>The next question we have to answer would seem to
be this: Could paederastia be regarded as a consequence
of the vengeance of Venus? As it is the Scythians
that are in question, the first thing would naturally appear
to be to determine what conception the Scythians
had of Venus. But inasmuch as the data are
lacking for any demonstration of the sort, while the
Scythians themselves ascribe the νοῦσος θήλεια to
the vengeance of Venus, we may very well refer
for a reply to this first question to the general
character of the cult of the goddess<a id="FNanchor_307_307" href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> and what
has been said on the whole subject above; and
herein there seems to exist no reason why we should
not answer the query asked above in the affirmative.
Granted that Venus was regarded as goddess of fruitfulness
or as dispenser of the joys of Love, then in either
aspect it was but natural she should withdraw the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
marks of her favour from the culprits (the paederasts).
These neither wished for posterity nor enjoyed the
delights connected with <i>natural</i> coition, but were
equally indifferent towards the one and towards
the other<a id="FNanchor_308_308" href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">308</a>; and the first sign of the vengeance of
the goddess consists in the withdrawal of her benefits.</p>

<p>How <i>Stark</i>, following the lead of an anonymous
French author quoted by <i>Larcher</i><a id="FNanchor_309_309" href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">309</a>, can maintain
there is no question of punishment here, as in that
case Venus would be acting against her own interest,
we fail to understand; and <i>Larcher</i> himself calls
this unknown writer <i>un homme d’esprit, mais peu
instruit</i> (witty but superficial). This is proof sufficient
in our opinion that only a jest is intended,
but one that <i>Stark</i>, p. 7 (notes 19 and 20.), has
taken with the utmost seriousness.</p>

<p>However our view is <i>directly</i> supported by another
myth, which <i>Dio Chrysostom</i> mentions, speaking of
the sweating at the armpits with which the Lemnian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
women were afflicted. According to this legend
Venus punishes the women of Lemnos<a id="FNanchor_310_310" href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">310</a>:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>
<p>“Haec Dea veluti etiam ceteri, sua sacrificia praetermitti
non aequo animo ferebat: quae cum Lemniae
mulieres Veneris sacrificia sprevissent, Deae
maxime iram in se concitasse creditae sunt, quod<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
etiam non impune putantur fecisse. <em class="gesperrt">Nam tantum
foetorem illis excitasse feminis
Dea perhibetur, ut a suis maritis contemnerentur.</em>”
(This goddess, no less than other
deities, could not bear the neglect of her proper sacrifices
with equanimity. Thus the women of Lemnos,
having omitted to perform these sacrifices of Venus, are
believed to have brought down on themselves the most
serious anger of the goddess, and this they are
accounted not to have done with impunity. <i>For
the goddess, as is related, caused such a foul odour to
arise among the women, that they were scorned by
their husbands.</i>) If the view mentioned just above
as taken by the Apostle Paul and by St. Athanasius
is the right one, it would seem that the Lemnian
women had suffered themselves to be used by their
husbands for purposes of paederastia; then as a
consequence there had been set up the evil odour
of the mouth and breath, and this had driven the
men to desert their wives to live with the captive
Thracian slave-women (<i>Apollonius</i>).</p>

<p>But indeed the Ancients generally, or at any
rate the Greeks and Romans, seem to have always
held the opinion that unnatural coition, as well as
all the similar forms of indulgence taking its place,
were a consequence of the wrath of Venus, against
whom the individuals had offended<a id="FNanchor_311_311" href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">311</a>. This appears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
also from the play of <i>Philoctetes</i>, of whom the <i>Scholiast</i>
to <i>Thucydides</i><a id="FNanchor_312_312" href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> says: “Moreover Philoctetes, having
on account of the death of Paris fallen sick of
the <i>feminine disease</i>, and being unable to bear the
shame of it, left his country and founded a city,
which in memory of his misfortune he named Malacia—Effeminacy.”
<i>Martial</i><a id="FNanchor_313_313" href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> had the same myth
in his mind when he wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent6">In Sertorium</div>
  <div class="verse">Mollis erat, facilisque viris Paeantius heros,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Vulnera sic Paradis dicitur ulta Venus.</div>
  <div class="verse">Cur lingat cunnum Siculus Sertorius, hoc est,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Ex hoc occisus, Rufe, videtur Eryx.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(To Sertorius.—The Hero, son of Paeas (Philoctetes),
was effeminate and easy of access to men;
in this way Venus is said to have avenged the
murder of Paris. Why should Sicilian Sertorius
lick the pudendum of women? this is why, because
it would appear, he was the slayer, Rufus, of a
man of Eryx.) Of course there can be no question
here of the disease which detained Philoctetes at
Lemnos and prevented his taking part in the expe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>dition
to Troy; and if the older legend says nothing
as to the νοῦσος θήλεια of Philoctetes, it is clear
from this (as Meier, loco citato, has shown) that
only in times when paederastia was becoming prevalent,
were all these legends invented, to get as
it were a sort of excuse by alleging a distinguished
predecessor in the practice. So <i>Martial</i> says, addressing
<i>Gaurus</i>:<a id="FNanchor_314_314" href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">314</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<p>(That you love to prolong the night with excess of
wine, I can excuse; you have the vice, Gaurus, of
Cato. That you write verses with no inspiration of
Muses and Apollo, for this, you should be praised;
it is a fault of Cicero’s you have. That you vomit,
well! ’twas a habit of Antony’s; that you are a
gourmand, ’twas Apicius’ weakness.—That you suck
(as a <i>fellator</i>), whose vice have you here, pray tell
me!) The above Epigram of <i>Martial’s</i> (To Sertorius)
shows very clearly how the poets represented each
form of unnatural indulgence of the sexual impulse
as vengeance of Venus. It is a <i>cunnilingus</i> that is
in question here, and his vice is accounted for in
this way:—just as Philoctetes on account of the
slaying of Paris had been punished by Venus with
paederastia, so the Sicilian Sertorius probably became
a <i>cunnilingus</i> because he had killed an inhabitant
of Eryx, where was situated a famous temple of
the goddess. Similarly it will not surprise us if
besides paederastia Philoctetes was saddled with the
vice of Onanism at a later period, as is implied in
the following poem of <i>Ausonius</i>:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span><a id="FNanchor_315_315" href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">315</a></p>

deadly luxury branded on the men of Nola. But
Crispa practises them all in her sole person: she
skins, she sucks, she works by either aperture, that
she may not leave anything untried, and so have

<p>No doubt <i>Stark</i>, p. 19, is quite right in saying
this passage has nothing to do with the θήλεια
νοῦσος; but the poet has by no means, as he puts
it in his note, <i>temporum ordine lapsus</i>,—committed
an anachronism. He makes no mention whatever
of any vengeance of Venus, saying nothing more
than that loneliness led the inheritor (of the arrows)
of Hercules to Onanism. This is not merely advancing
a conjecture, as <i>Stark</i> does, but (to say nothing of
the <i>Lemnia egestas</i>—Lemnian loneliness), admits of
being legitimately developed from the whole sequence
of thought in the Epigram. Crispa’s vices are
mentioned in the order of their shamefulness. The
least disgraceful is Onanism, such as Philoctetes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
practised, next comes the vice of the <i>cinaedus</i> and
of the <i>pathic</i>, for which Afranius serves as example,
and lastly <i>fellation</i>. Thus it shows a complete want
of comprehension, when the commentators quote
the scholion to Thucydides given a little above
as an explanation. Had Philoctetes been referred
to as a <i>pathic</i>, the succeeding verse would be entirely
superfluous; which verse does not receive a word of
notice from the expositors, presumably because they
failed to understand the allusion. The true explanation
is afforded by a passage in <i>Quintilian</i>:<a id="FNanchor_316_316" href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> “Togatis
excellit Afranius, <em class="gesperrt">utinamque non inquinasset
argumenta puerorum foedis amoribus</em>,
mores suos fassus.” (Afranius excels in <i>fabulae
togatae</i> (polite comedies), and it were to be wished
he had not defiled his plots by disgusting intrigues
with boys, thereby discovering his own morals).
<i>Forberg</i>, loco citato p. 283, quotes this passage
indeed, but explains (both here and on p. 343) the
<i>libido</i> (lust) of Philoctetes as being that of the <i>pathic</i>.</p>

<p>To prove that Venus manifested her wrath in the
way specified, we may further cite the race of the
daughters of Helios, whom she punished by the
infliction of licentious love. Thus <i>Hyginus</i> says:<a id="FNanchor_317_317" href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">317</a>
Soli ob indicium (concubitus cum Marte) Venus ad
<em class="gesperrt">progeniem</em> eius semper fuit inimica, (Because of
the Sun’s revelation (of her intrigue with Mars)
Venus was ever a bitter enemy of his posterity);
and Seneca:<a id="FNanchor_318_318" href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">318</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span></p>

<p>(Venus, loathing the posterity of the hated Sun,
punishes on us the fetters that bound her lover Mars
and her. <i>With abominable and disgraceful practices</i>
she afflicts the whole race of Phoebus).</p>

<p>An example of such vengeance is afforded by
Pasiphaë, of whom the Scholiast on the passage of
Lucian cited below relates how, Ἡλίου οὖσα ἐκ
μήνιδος Ἀφροδίτης ταύρου ἠράσθη, (being a
daughter of the Sun, she became enamoured of a
bull through the influence of angry Aphrodité), a
fable which might very well be explained—for ταύρος
(a bull), like κένταυρος (a Centaur), occurs in the
sense of paederast—as meaning that she had become
a female pathic. So Theomnestus says in <i>Lucian</i>:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span><a id="FNanchor_319_319" href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">319</a>
“So lecherous a look resides in the eyes, that
compelling all beauty to its will, it can find no
satiety. And often was I uncertain whether this were
not some spite of Aphrodité. Yet am I none of the
children of Helios, neither a natural heir of the
Lemnian women, nor puffed up with the scornful
insensibility of Hippolytus, that I could have provoked
against me such an implacable hatred on the part
of the goddess)”. <i>Philo Judaeus</i><a id="FNanchor_320_320" href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">320</a> also represents
paederastia as a punishment of such men as married
a woman legally repudiated, and the like: πρὸς
δὲ συμβάσεις εἴ τις ἐθέλοι χωρεῖν ἀνὴρ τῇ τοιαύτῃ
γυναικὶ, <em class="gesperrt">μαλακίας καὶ ἀνανδρίας
ἐκφερέσθω δόξαν</em>, ὡς ἐκ τετμημένος τῆς
ψυχῆς τὸ βιωφελέστατον μισοπόνηρον πάθος....
δίκην οὖν τινέτω σὺν τῇ γυναικί. (But if any man
should wish to enter into contracts with such a
woman, let him bear the <i>ill-repute of softness and
effeminacy</i>, as having eradicated from his soul that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
sentiment of hatred for ill-doers which is most useful
for life,—So let him pay his penalty along with the
woman). In <i>Athenaeus</i> one of the speakers exclaims
(Deipnos., XIII. p. 605 D.): Ὁρᾶτε οὖν καὶ ὑμεῖς,
οἱ φιλόσοφοι <em class="gesperrt">παρὰ φύσιν τῇ</em> Ἀφροδίτῃ χρώμενοι,
καὶ <em class="gesperrt">ἀσεβοῦντες εἰς τὴν θεὸν</em>, μὴ τὸν
αὐτὸν διαφθαρῆτε τρόπον. (Beware then ye too,
philosophers who indulge the pleasures of Aphrodité
<i>against nature, and act impiously towards the goddess</i>,
that ye be not destroyed in the same way).</p>

<p>According to <i>Diodorus</i> (V. 55) the sons of Neptune
in consequence of the wrath of Venus plunged into
such madness that they violated their mother. The
Propontides, who had denied the godhead of Venus,
were cast by her into such an amorous phrenzy that
they publicly gave themselves to men, and they were
subsequently turned into stones.<a id="FNanchor_321_321" href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> Myrrha, whose
mother proclaimed herself to be fairer than Venus,
was driven by the goddess into unchastity with her
own father.<a id="FNanchor_322_322" href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">322</a></p>

<p>In later times this idea was even transferred to
the Star of Venus. The following appears in <i>Firmicus</i>
“In octavo ab horoscopo loco, Mercurius cum Venere,
si vespertini ambo, inefficaces et apocopos reddent,
et qui nihil agere possint.” (In the eighth place of
the horoscope, Mercury in conjunction with Venus,
if both are evening stars, will make men impotent
eunuchs and such as can effect nothing.)—a notion
that first arose perhaps from the name Hermaphroditus<a id="FNanchor_323_323" href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">323</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span></p>

<p>Thus there would be nothing inconsistent with
the views universally held in Antiquity in considering
the νοῦσος θήλεια (feminine disease) of the Scythians,
and equally that of Philoctetes, as consequences of the
wrath of Venus. That paederastia was invariably
regarded as a <i>Vice</i> by the Ancients (and particularly
by the Greeks) we have already, following the lines
laid down by <i>Meier</i>, we think sufficiently proved.
<i>Stark</i>, who repeatedly (pp. 12, 16, 20.) denies this,
has been led into error merely by the mistake that
was generally prevalent in his time of confusing
paedophilia and paederastia; and it is on this
misapprehension he bases his argument. How the
Scythians came to hold this belief that the wrath
of Venus was to blame for what they suffered,
must indeed be left an open question. But it
should be remembered it was not the <i>pathics</i> themselves
who advanced this opinion, but only the
rest of the Scythians; for Herodotus says expressly,
λέγουσί τε οἱ Σκύθαι διὰ τοῦτο <em class="gesperrt">σφεας</em> νοσέειν
(and the Scythians say that for this cause <i>they</i> were
afflicted). Again it was only ὀλίγοι τινὲς αὐτῶν
ὑπολειφθέντες (a few of the Scythians who were
left behind), a few of the stragglers, who would
seem to have plundered the temple of Aphrodité;
and it certainly was only later that this act of
impiety was brought into connection with the vice,—in
the same way as the killing of Paris by Philoctetes
was with the legend of his lewd practices.</p>


<h4>§ 15.</h4>

<p>The second question we have to answer will be
this: how could Herodotus write <i>that the descendants
of these few stragglers alive in his time suffered from
the</i> <em class="gesperrt">νοῦσος θήλεια</em> (<i>feminine disease</i>)? From<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
the fact that, while descendants are named, strictly
speaking only <i>male</i> descendants can be in question,
it is clear the statement is only a general one, and
must not be understood to imply more than that
certain members of these families were Cinaedi, not
of course that the <i>whole</i> posterity was afflicted with
the νοῦσος θήλεια. We see at the present day
how the impurity of the father passes on to the
son; so it need be matter for no surprise whatever
to find the vice of the cinaedi descending in the
same way among certain members of a family. As
a matter of fact these Scythian temple-robbers are
by no means the only examples Antiquity holds
up to us of such a thing, for the Orator <i>Lysias</i><a id="FNanchor_324_324" href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">324</a>
says of the family of <i>Alcibiades</i>, that <i>most members
of it had become prostitutes</i>.</p>

<p>What is more, the opinion was avowedly and
directly held by the Ancients, that pathics were
born with the predisposition to the vice. In particular
<i>Parmenides</i> (509 B.C.) expressed this view in
a Fragment, which <i>Caelius Aurelianus</i><a id="FNanchor_325_325" href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> has preserved
in a chapter of his Work. This chapter treats
solely of the vice of the pathic, and is of the
greatest importance for our subject. We could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
forgo quoting it in full, particularly as it is the
sole authority for the views held by physicians on
this vice, and up to now appears to have been
entirely overlooked.</p>

pueros hac passione iactari. Similiter enim senibus
virili indigent officio, quod in ipsis est nondum,
illos deseruit.” (On effeminate men or <i>subservients</i>,
called μαλθακοὶ—soft, effeminate, by the Greeks.—Effeminate
men, or <i>subservients</i>, were called by the
Greeks μαλθακοὶ. A <i>man</i> finds it difficult to believe
in the existence of such creatures. For it was not
nature prompted the introduction of this as part of
human habits; rather was it lust that, expelling
shame, subjected to foul uses parts of the body that
should never have been so employed. For no limit
being set to passion, and no hope of satiety being
entertained, the several members find each its own
realm insufficient; whereas divine providence destined
the different portions of the body to perform definite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
functions. In fine they go out of their way to allure
by dress and gait and other feminine attributes,
things unconnected with bodily emotions, being rather
due to a corrupted mind. For often, moved by
fear, or (however difficult to believe) by shame,
towards persons whom they happen to respect, they
change of a sudden and for a brief space seek
to show marks of manly power; but not knowing
where to put the limit, they are again carried away
by excess, and going beyond what is fit for an honest
man are involved in yet greater offences. Thus it
is evident, in <i>our</i> opinion, that such men have a
sense of the true state of things. For theirs is, as
Soranus declares, the passion of a corrupt and utterly
foul mind. For as women that are called <i>Tribades</i>,
because they practise the love of either sex, are
eager to have intercourse with women more than
with men, and pursue these with a jealousy almost
as violent as a man’s, and when they have been
deserted by their love or for the time being
superseded, seek to do to other women what they
are known to suffer, and winning from their double
sex a pleasure in giving pleasure, like persons
deboshed by constant drunkenness, being nurtured
on evil habitude, delight in wrongs to their own
sex,—even so these men (pathics) are seen by a
comparison with women of this sort to be tormented
with a passion that is of the mind. For no bodily
treatment it is rightly deemed should be adopted
to expel the passion, rather must the mind be
disciplined which is afflicted with such a pollution
of vices.</p>

<p>For no man ever remedied a prurient body by
foul practices as a woman, nor got mitigation by
contact of the male member, but concurrently he
suffered some complaint or pain from a different
(material) cause. So in fact the history of a cure
given by Clodius is found to be really a case of
recovery from “ascaridae”, which writers on intestinal
worms have shown are a kind of worm born in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
the region of the rectum or straight gut. <i>Parmenides</i>
in his books on natural science says “<i>Effeminate
men or <em class="gesperrt">subservients</em> occasionally bring forth as a
result of conception</i>.” But as his Epigram is in
Greek, I will imitate it in verse; so I have composed
Latin lines like the original so far as I could
make them, that there might not be a mixture of
the two languages:—“When a woman and a man
together mingle in the veins the seeds of love, the
formative virtue that moulds of the diverse blood,
if it keep due proportion, makes well-framed bodies.
But if the virtues are discordant in the commingled
seed, and have no unity, in the commingled body
furies will torment the nascent sex with two-fold
seed.” He means that over and above the material
seed there are certain virtues residing in it; and if
these have commingled in such a way as to have
one and the same operative force in the same body,
then they produce one single will that tallies with
the sex. But if when the bodily seed was commingled,
the virtues remained separate, the appetite for love
of both kinds must pursue the offspring.</p>

<p>Many leading doctors of the schools moreover
declare that the passion is innate, and <i>therefore
passes on with the seed to descendants</i>, not indeed
hereby incriminating nature, which teaches men the
bounds of its purity by the example of other animals
(for animals are called by wise men nature’s mirrors),
but rather the human race that retains so obstinately
vices once adopted, that by no renewal can it be
purified, and has left no room for change. Similarly
a <i>mental</i> depravity grows graver as men advance in
life, whereas most affections of the <i>body</i>, whether
innate or adventitious, get weaker as men get older,
for instance gout, epilepsy and madness, and so as
age advances undoubtedly grow milder. For all
troublesome factors will produce strong effects in
proportion to the firmness to resist possessed by
the affected parts, and as this firmness is deficient
in old men, so the complaint or passion diminishes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
in intensity, as does the general strength. <i>But</i> that
passion which makes men subservient or effeminate,
grows stronger and more serious as the body grows
old and stirs the sufferers with yet more abominable
lustfulness,—and not without a reason. For at other
ages, the body being still strong and capable of
performing the natural offices of love, there is no
division of lust into double forms of wantonness,
through their mind being tossed to and fro now
by passive now by active lewdness. But in such
as have failed from age, and become incapable of
the manly office of love, all the wantonness of the
mind is directed on the appetite for the opposite
form of gratification; and for this cause a woman
demands love more strongly than a man. In fact
many conjecture it is for this reason that boys also
are tormented by this passion. For they resemble
old men in lacking power for the virile function.
It is not yet born in boys; old men have lost it.)</p>

<p>To leave on one side for the present the many
inferences of various sorts that this passage of <i>Caelius
Aurelianus</i> must necessarily lead us to, as they will
find a more suitable place later on, and to return
to our question,—the mere fact of Herodotus
mentioning posterity at all ought of itself to be
sufficient to negative any idea of actual eunuchs,
of loss of the generative power. For had the
Scythians returning from Ascalon lost this power,
they could have had no more descendants, and
therefore the νούσος θήλεια could not have passed
on to these, but must have become extinct with
the original sufferers. On the other hand children
already begotten by them before that period could
have been in no way influenced by a disease communicable
through the act of generation. Accordingly
the νοῦσος θήλεια cannot possibly have affected
<i>these</i> Scythians so as to annihilate the power of
generation. Both must have co-existed side by side;
and the contrary can never be proved from anything
<i>Herodotus</i> says. As to another passage of Herodotus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
that might seem to demand some notice here, where
the expression ἀνδρόγυνος (man-woman) is put
side by side with ἐνάρεες, we will speak subsequently.</p>


<h4>§ 16.</h4>

<p><i>But</i>, it is maintained by those who take a different
view,—the individuals who suffered from the νοῦσος
θήλεια (feminine disease) could be recognized as
doing so by their looks; thus it cannot have been
a mere vice, it must have been an actual bodily
complaint. We will not say a word more insisting
on the declarations general amongst ancient writers,
for example the words of <i>Ovid</i>: <i>Heu! quam difficile
est crimen non prodere vultu</i> (Alas! how difficult it is
not to betray a vice by the look), but will simply
ask the question,—<i>had the Ancients really no bodily
marks of identification</i> by which they could recognise
in an individual the vice of the pathic or cinaedus?
On this point we must look to the Physiognomists
for information, and as a matter of fact they supply
it in considerable completeness. First of all Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_329_329" href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">329</a>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span></p>

<p>“<i>Distinguishing Masks of the Cinaedus</i>:</p>

<p>“An eye broken-down, as it were, knees bent
inwards, inclination of the head to the right side;
movements of the hands always back downwards
and flaccid, the gait double, as it were, one leg
being crossed over the other in walking, the gaze
wandering; such a man for example was the
Sophist Dionysius.” Polemo enters into greater detail<a id="FNanchor_330_330" href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">330</a>:</p>

<p>“<i>Distinguishing Marks of the Androgynus</i> (<i>Man-woman</i>):
“The <i>man-woman</i> has a lecherous and
wanton look, he rolls his eyes and lets his gaze
wander; forehead and cheeks twitch, eyebrows are
drawn together to a point, neck bent, hips in
continual movement. All the limbs twitch spasmodically,
knees and hands seeming to crack; like an
ox he glares round him and fixes his eyes on the
ground. He speaks with a thin voice, at once
croaking and shrill, exceedingly uncertain and
trembling.” In very similar terms the pathic is
sketched by Adamantus<a id="FNanchor_331_331" href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">331</a>. <i>Dio Chrysostom</i> in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
speech cited a little above<a id="FNanchor_332_332" href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> relates how “a physiognomist
had come into a certain city, in order to
give an exhibition of his art there, and declared
he could tell by looking at any individual whether
he were brave or timid, a boaster or a debauchee,
a cinaedus or an adulterer. A man was brought
to him who had a meagre body, eyebrows grown
together, a dirty look, who was in evil condition,
with callosities on his hands, and dressed in coarse
gray clothing, one that was overgrown with hair to
the knuckles, and ill-shaved, and the physiognomist
was asked, what sort of a man he was. When he
had looked at him a considerable time, and at the
end was still uncertain, as it seems to me, what
he should finally say, he declared he did not know
and ordered the man to go. But when the latter
sneezed, just as he was going, he cried out instantly
he was a cinaedus. Thus the sneeze betrayed the
man’s habits, and prevented them, in spite of all
the rest, from continuing hid.” No doubt the man’s
walk had already given the Physiognomist an indication,
and the gesture he made when he sneezed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
quickly confirmed his Diagnosis. In fact the cinaedus
probably made a grip at his posterior as he sneezed,
so as to close the orifice, the weakened or possibly
ruptured <i>Sphincter ani</i> no longer being able to
perform this office (χαυνοπρώκτος,—wide-breeched,
in Aristophanes!). Indeed with a healthy <i>Sphincter</i>
it is often hardly possible during a sneeze to keep
back the out-rush of wind and even of the more
liquid faeces.<a id="FNanchor_333_333" href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">333</a></p>

<p>Further the following passage of Lucian should be
quoted in this connection:<a id="FNanchor_334_334" href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">334</a></p>

<p>“But I tell you, pathic,—your habits are so obvious
that even the blind and the deaf cannot fail to
recognise them. If you only open your mouth to
speak, only undress at the baths, nay, if you do
not yourself undress, but only your slaves put off
their garments, what think you,—are not all your
secrets of the night at once revealed? Now just
tell me, if your Sophist Bassus, or the flute-player
Batalus, or the cinaedus Hemitheon of Sybaris,
who wrote your beautiful laws, how you must
polish the skin, and pluck out the hair (with
tweezers), how you must submit to the performance
of paederastia, and how yourselves perform it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>—
now if one of these men should throw a lion’s skin
round him, and enter with a club in his hand, what
would the spectators really believe?—that it was
Hercules? Surely not, unless they were utterly
blear-eyed. A thousand things betray such a
masquerade,—gait, look, voice,<a id="FNanchor_335_335" href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> the bowed neck,
the ceruse, the mastich, the paint on the cheeks
that you make yourselves up with; in a word it
were easier, as the proverb says, to hide five
elephants under your armpit than to conceal one
cinaedus!”</p>

<p>Now if the <i>natural</i> marks of identification that
have been specified were sufficient to betray the
cinaedus, even when he was devoid of all external
adornment from art,<a id="FNanchor_336_336" href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> how much more readily recognizable
must the pathic become, if he arranged his
get-up and costume to match his shameful practices,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span><a id="FNanchor_337_337" href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">337</a>
and that this was so <i>Martial</i> affords evidence in
countless places. In fact these male whores used
to have the beard quite clean shaven (ἐξυρημένοι
close-shaven) and not merely on the posteriors but
generally all over the body, with the exception of
the head, carefully removed the hair, so as make
themselves more like women.</p>

<p>(Directly, if a man play women’s parts, the body
must have its share in the characterization), Aristophanes
makes Agatho say at the Thesmophoria,
where Mnesilochus has been transformed into a
woman by means of depilation, so as to be able
to back up the women in opposition to Euripides
in their attacks on him at that festival.</p>

<p>On the other hand cinaedi let the hair of the
head grow long<a id="FNanchor_338_338" href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">338</a> (comae,—long locks), and dressed
altogether like women. Hence the reply of the
Cynic <i>Diogenes</i><a id="FNanchor_339_339" href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> to a young man clothed after this

<i>Socrates.</i>—They can easily make themselves anything
they please. And so, if they but catch sight of one
of those long-haired, ruffianly, shaggy fellows, such
a man as Xenophantus’ son for example, straightway
in derision of their folly they change into Centaurs.
And now when they beheld Cleisthenes, see you? they
became women!) <i>Cleisthenes</i> was a notorious cinaedus
at Athens, whom Aristophanes had made a special
butt for his wit; for example, he makes Mnesilochus,
mentioned just above, after his transformation into
a woman, say,—he looks just like Cleisthenes now.</p>

<p>The evidence adduced will, we think, be sufficient
to show that the Scythians had good reason for
saying, that with persons in this case (cinaedi) it
was easy to <i>recognise by looking at them</i> what stamp
of men they were: and that <i>Juvenal</i><a id="FNanchor_341_341" href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> was right
when he wrote:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent10">Verius ergo</div>

  <div class="verse"><i>Imputo, qui vultu morbum incessuque fatetur</i>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(More truly then and more candidly Peribomius
says: the man I consider a victim of fate, who in
face and gait betrays the disease he suffers from.)—a
passage that strongly confirms what has been
advanced. Peribomius is quite candid, he confesses
to being a pathic, for in any case his appearance
would betray the fact. He finds the less reason
to deny it, as he regards the vice which has
mastered him as an infliction of providence (<i>fatis
imputo</i>). Here is proof that the opinion of the
Greeks as to the pathic’s being one who had
incurred the anger of the gods, was still commonly
held in Juvenal’s time, though perhaps less as a
matter of conviction than in order to provide an
excuse for indulgence. So we must further read
<i>hoc</i> for <i>hunc</i> in the passage (<i>hoc ego fatis imputo</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>—
<i>this</i> I regard as an infliction of fate); unless indeed
we construe thus, <i>ego, qui morbum vultu incessuque
fatetur, hunc (sc. morbum) fatis imputo</i>. “I in truth,—as
for the man who confesses by look and gait his
disease, <i>this disease</i> I regard as an infliction of fate.”
The words are obviously Peribomius’ own expression
of opinion; and directly afterwards the poet goes on:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Horum simplicitas miserabilis, his furor ipse</div>
  <div class="verse">Dat veniam: sed peiores, qui talia verbis</div>

  <div class="verse">Clunem agitant.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(These men’s simplicity moves our pity; their
very infatuation craves pardon. But worse are they
who enter such courses with Hercules’ words on
their lips, and prating of manly virtue, heave the
wanton buttocks.)</p>


<h4>§ 17.</h4>

<p>But the passage just quoted from <i>Juvenal</i> is of
still greater importance for another reason. In it
the vice of the cinaedus is called <i>morbus</i> (a disease);
and in virtue of its explicitness it is sufficient by
itself to settle all doubts as to this being a usual
mode of expression with the Romans, who ordinarily
designated any vice by this name<a id="FNanchor_342_342" href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">342</a>. The only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
question remaining will be, Did the <i>Greeks</i> also use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
this form of expression? Any scholar possessed of
a special acquaintance with the Greek language will
most certainly not hesitate an instant to answer
this question in the affirmative, the Lexicographers
having long ago collected an exhaustive list of
examples of such use<a id="FNanchor_343_343" href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">343</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p>

<p><i>Plutarch</i><a id="FNanchor_344_344" href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">344</a> says, comparing the action of the Sun
with that of Love:— Καὶ μὴν οὔτε σώματος ἀγύμναστος
ἕξις ἥλιον, οὒτε Ἔρωτα δύναται φέρειν
ἀλύπως τρόπος ἀπαιδεύτου ψυχῆς· ἐξίσταται δ’
ὁμοίως ἐκάτερον καὶ <em class="gesperrt">νοσεῖ, τὴν του θεοῦ
δύναμιν, οὐ τὴν αὑτοῦ μεμφόμενον
ἀσθένειαν</em>.—(ch. XXIII.) Τὴν μὲν πρὸς
ἄῤῥενα ἄῤῥενος ὁμιλίαν, μᾶλλον δὲ ἀκρασίαν καὶ
ἐπιπήδησιν εἴποι τις ἂν ἐννοήσας,</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Ὕβρις</em> τάδ’ <em class="gesperrt">οὐχ</em> ἡ Κύπρις ἐξεργάζεται.</p>

<p>Διὸ τοὺς μὲν ἡδομένους τῷ πάσχειν εἰς τὸ
χείριστον τιθέμενοι γένος κακίας, οὔτε πίστεως
μοῖραν, οὔτε αἰδοῦς.... Ἀλλὰ πολλὰ φαῦλα καὶ
μανικὰ τῶν γυναικῶν ἐρώτων· Τὶ δὲ οὐχὶ πλείονα
τῶν παιδικῶν; Ἀλλ’ ὥσπερ τοῦτο παιδομανία
<em class="gesperrt">τὸ πάθος</em>, οὐδέτερον δὲ Ἔρως ἔστιν. (And in
fact neither can an untrained body bear the sun,
nor can any fashion of uneducated soul bear Love
(Eros) without pain; but each equally is disorganized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
and grows sick, having to blame the power of the
god, not its own weakness.—ch. XXIII.—Now
intercourse of male with male one would rather call,
after due reflection, incontinence and violent assault.</p>

<p>“’Tis <i>overmastering insolence</i> works this result, not
love (Cypris).”<a id="FNanchor_345_345" href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">345</a></p>

<p>Wherefore such as take pleasure in pathic lust,
devoting themselves to the vilest kind of wickedness,
have no portion in honour or in modesty.—Indeed
much there is base and insane in amours with
women; how much more so in those with boys!
Now the name of the latter passion is paedomania—<a id="FNanchor_346_346" href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">346</a>madness
for boys,—but <i>neither</i> kind is Love—Eros).</p>

<p>These passages are of the highest importance in
connection with our subject, as confirming in the
most distinct manner what has been said above as
to the wrath of Venus; but for the sake of greater
clearness they had to be held over for discussion
till now. It is clearly stated in them: that paederastia
is no work of Venus, i.e. not an expression or
consequence of the customary activity of the goddess,
but a ὕβρις (act of insolent violence) and the consequence
of ὕβρις i.e. of some act that has roused
the anger of the gods. Here we have the oldest
view of all: that paederastia is a consequence of
the vengeance of Venus, arising in consequence of
a ὕβρις, and again in turn itself constituting a ὕβρις.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span><a id="FNanchor_347_347" href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">347</a></p>

<p>But besides this the later view of a more enlightened
time is also implied. According to this it was not
any δύναμις τοῦ θεοῦ (operation of a god’s might),
but simply an ἀσθενεία or ἀκρασία<a id="FNanchor_348_348" href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> (weakness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
incontinence) of the individual that was in question,
(and it is for this reason <i>Plutarch</i> quotes the line
of <i>Manetho</i>, an old and obscure poet, in this sense);<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
Paederastia was called a πάθος, a form of insanity
(παιδομανία—madness for boys), and was not looked
upon in any sense as a consequence of the power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
of Eros—Love. That the vice was also called
νόσος (a disease) is shown,—not to mention the
expression νοῦσος θήλεια (feminine <i>disease</i>), which
we have yet to fully explain,—by the Speech of
Dio Chrysostom cited above, as well as by a number
of passages quoted in the course of our investigation,—e.g.
on p. 125. In the “Wasps” of <i>Aristophanes</i>,
<i>Xanthias</i> relates how a son had confined his father
and put him under surveillance, and then goes on
(vv. 71 sqq.):</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse"><em class="gesperrt">νόσον</em> γὰρ ὁ πατὴρ ἀλλόκοτον αὐτοῦ <em class="gesperrt">νοσεῖ </em>,</div>
  <div class="verse">ἣν οὐδ’ ἂν εἷς γνοίη ποτ’ οὐδὲ ξυμβάλῃ,</div>
  <div class="verse">εἰ μὴ πύθοιθ’ ἡμῶν· ἐπεὶ τοπάζετε·</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(For his father is <i>sick</i> of a portentous <i>sickness</i>,
one that no one would ever know or conjecture
the nature of, unless he should have learned it
from us; for if you doubt me, guess yourselves.)</p>

<p>Love of play is suggested, and love of drink, love
of sacrifice and finally love of winning guests and
seeing them at his house (φιλόξενον—lover of guests),
which last conjecture Sosias understands in an obscene
sense as implying a cinaedus, and (vv. 84 sqq.) says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">μὰ τὸν κύν’, ὦ Νικόστρατ’, οὐ φιλόξενος,</div>
  <div class="verse">ἐπεὶ καταπύγων ἐστὶν ὅγε Φιλόξενος,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(No! no! by heavens! Nicostratus, not a lover
of guests (φιλόξενος) for our friend Philoxenus is
a man given to unnatural lust,) where φιλόξενος
and καταπύγων are explained as being synonymous.
Now if paederastia had not been a disease, how
should they have come to call a man φιλόξενος,
when guessing the form his sickness took? For the
rest there was a well-known cinaedus Philoxenus, to
whom allusion is made. The scholiast quotes a
very noteworthy line from <i>Eupolis</i> (in the “Urbes”)
or else from Phrynichus (“in the Satyrs”) as follows:</p>

<p>
ἔστι δέ τις <em class="gesperrt">θήλεια</em> Φιλόξενος ἐκ Διομείων.<br />
<br />

(And there is a certain <i>female</i> Philoxenus of Diomeia);</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span></p>

<p>The healthy good sense of the Greeks could not
possibly regard the vice of the Pathic otherwise than
as a deviation from Nature, an <i>unnatural</i> appetite;
<i>and</i> every <i>unnatural</i> appetite (ἀκολασία—“intemperance”)
was a νόσος or πάθος (disease, or suffering,
passion), or a consequence of these, as the passages
quoted from <i>Aristotle</i> and elsewhere show conclusively.
From the point of view of the paederast reasons
perhaps were to be discovered, that appeared to
justify his peculiar taste; and the mode in which
he obtained the titillation of sensual pleasure was
looked upon merely as one way of getting rid of
the semen, as a <i>figura Veneris</i> (mode of Love) standing
in close relationship with Onanism. The paederast
was relegated to the category of voluptuaries, but
without his incurring any special condemnation. On
the other hand for the pathic who lent himself
as subject of the vice, no excuse of this sort was
forthcoming. His lust was not seen (this was impossible
at the time) to have a bodily origin in “prurigo
ani” (itching of the anus), and could only be regarded
as springing from a <i>depraved imagination</i> (ἀνίατον
νόσον ψυχῆς ἡγούμενος—deeming it an incurable
disease of the soul); it must be that a demon had
dragged him along irresistibly in his train, and drove
his victim who was incapable of helping himself
(ἀσθενής—“weak”) to degradation.</p>

<p>All men thus held in thrall by evil demons were
supposed to have offended against the gods, to
have roused their anger, and were avoided and
shunned by their fellows. If in addition they
showed any traces of mental aberration, madness,
epileptic convulsions, or the like, rude peoples saw in
<i>these</i> the manifestation of a god’s influence, and
took the victim’s sayings and dreams for oracles. So
<i>Herodotus</i> relates (IV. 67.) that the Scythians considered
the  ἐναρέες to have received the gift of prophecy
from Aphrodité,—οἱ δὲ ἐναρέες οἱ ἀνδρόγυνοι,
τὴν Ἀφροδίτην σφισι λέγουσι μαντικὴν δοῦναι
(now the ἐναρέες, the men-women, declare that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
Venus brought madness on the object of her anger),
and held the vice of the pathic to be due to the
goddess’s wrath, or at a later time to be an (incurable)
disease of the soul (ψυχή),—as is proved again by
the passage of <i>Caelius Aurelianus</i> already quoted;
but they did <i>not</i> ascribe to such men the power of
prophecy, though in a certain sense every actual madman
was supposed to possess it<a id="FNanchor_349_349" href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">349</a>. For the vice of
the pathic was not in the eyes of the Greeks actual
madness, but rather a vice (νόσος—disease) that
robbed the sufferer of the power of governing himself<a id="FNanchor_350_350" href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">350</a>,
in the same sense as they called sexual love a
madness. From this point of view therefore the
commentators who saw in the νοῦσος θήλεια a
mental affliction, had some grounds for their view;
but should not have lost sight of the fact of its
being a <i>vice</i> at the same time.</p>

<p>But why did the νοῦσος (disease) receive the
epithet θήλεια (feminine)? Taking the word to be
used <i>passively</i>,—as obviously is done by those who
make out the νοῦσος θήλεια to have been an affection
similar in character to menstruation,—we might
find its explanation in the dictum of Tiresias, who, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
is well known, ascribed to the woman the greater
pleasure in the act of coition. From this fact,—if
it is a fact,—a greater longing on the part of the
woman for coition may be deduced; for which reason
<i>Plato</i> compared the <i>uterus</i> (womb) to a wild beast.
Thus the νοῦσος θήλεια would be <i>feminine concupiscence</i>.
Just as the woman longs intensely for natural
coition with the man, in the same way and with a
like intensity does the pathic long after unnatural<a id="FNanchor_351_351" href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">351</a>.
Thus the punishment inflicted by Venus would have
consisted in the goddess having implanted in the
man the concupiscence of a woman.</p>

<p>If on the other hand θήλεια (feminine) is taken
in an <i>active</i> sense, as it is by <i>Stark</i> and other interpreters,—and
with greater correctness, then the
νοῦσος θήλεια is <i>a form of lust that transforms men
into women</i>,—and this can be said of paederastia
in several senses, as is manifest from what
has been said already on preceding pages. The
Pathic becomes a woman, because he renounces
his man’s prerogative, as being the stronger, to
play the <i>active</i> part<a id="FNanchor_352_352" href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">352</a>, and assumes instead the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
<i>passive</i> rôle of the woman<a id="FNanchor_353_353" href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">353</a>, Entering into compe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>tition
as he does with the ladies of pleasure in
courting the favour of men, he has recourse to all
the arts they invoke to gain their object; and seeks
by artificial means to bring his body into as close
a resemblance as possible to the female form. He
dresses himself out like a woman of pleasure,
adopts female dress, and lets the hair of the head
grow long, whilst at the same time he carefully
eradicates by the process of <i>dropacismus</i> (use of
pitch-ointment as a depilatory) every trace of
hair on other parts of the person, even sacrificing
what was the chief ornament of a man in Ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
times,—his beard<a id="FNanchor_354_354" href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">354</a>. All this was done by the hero
of <i>Aristophanes’</i> “Thesmophoriazusae”, and without
a doubt an underlying irony <i>à propos</i> of the pathics
was at the bottom of the poet’s conception. Care
of the skin, such as women adopt, by means of
baths, friction with pumice-stone, etc. complete
the feminine appearance<a id="FNanchor_355_355" href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">355</a>,—hence the expressions
μάλακος, μαλθακός (soft or effeminate) for the
pathic, μαλακία, μαλθακία (softness, effeminacy)
for the pathic’s vice; and outraged Nature
avenges herself by seconding his endeavours. In
consequence of the stretching of the fundament, the
buttocks become broader towards the lower part,
and the space between them wider, causing the
hips to take more the shape they have in a woman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
the pelvis itself seems to be enlarged, while the
legs lose their straightness and the knees bend more
and more inwards (<b>γονύκροτος</b>—knock-kneed,)—in
short the whole of the lower half of the body
assumes the <i>feminine</i> type.</p>

<p>Deterioration of body is followed by deterioration
of mind, and the character also grows womanish.<a id="FNanchor_356_356" href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">356</a>
The pathic despises intercourse with women, and
will not enter into marriage, so long as he continues
to find his lust satisfied. When this ceases to be the
case as years advance, Nature herself forbids his propagating
his race; the genital organs that have withered
through disuse and refuse their office.<a id="FNanchor_357_357" href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">357</a> Driven from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
the society of men, he takes refuge, neither woman
nor man himself, with the women, who in contempt
use him as a slave, and like Omphalé of old with
Hercules, put the distaff into his hands! Thus from
the νοῦσος θήλεια, the vice, an actual disease has
sprung; and we can now see that <i>Longinus</i><a id="FNanchor_358_358" href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">358</a> was
surely right in calling the expression of <i>Herodotus</i>
ἀμίμητος,—an <i>inimitable</i> one, for certainly in no
more concise or better way can the facts and the
consequences of the vice of the Pathic be characterized.</p>

<p>However if any one should consider all this still
insufficient to prove the case, and regard the indication
given by <i>Longinus</i> as not explicit enough, he may
learn from <i>Tiberius the Rhetorician</i><a id="FNanchor_359_359" href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">359</a> that as a matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
of fact the Ancients understood the νοῦσος θήλεια
in Herodotus in this and in no other sense. He says:</p>

<p>“Now a paraphrase is when authors alter a simple,
straightforward statement of fact that is complete,
for the sake of style or effect or sublimity of
phrase, and express the matter in other words, and
these more forcible and suitable; as e.g. in <i>Herodotus</i>,
when he wrote ἐνέσκηψεν ἡ θεὸς θήλειαν νόσον
(the goddess afflicted them with <i>feminine disease</i>)
instead of “made them men-women or cinaedi”.
The word ἀνδρόγυνος (man-woman) is used here
in the same way as in another passage where
<i>Herodotus</i> says<a id="FNanchor_360_360" href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">360</a>, οἱ δὲ ἐνάρεες, οἱ ἀνδρόγυνοι (and
the ἐνάρεες, the men-women). The false interpretation
of this word has more than anything else
led to misunderstanding as to the νοῦσος θήλεια,
for it was supposed that by ἀνδρόγυνοι (men-women)
actual eunuchs were intended, whereas pathics are
meant and nothing more. How the case really stood
might have been seen from <i>Suidas</i>, who tells us:
<em class="gesperrt">ἀνδρόγυνος</em>· ὁ Διόνυσος, <em class="gesperrt">ὡς καὶ τὰ ἀνδρῶν
ποιῶν καὶ τὰ γυναικῶν πάσχων</em>· ἢ ἄνανδρος
καὶ Ἑρμαφρόδιτος· καὶ ἀνδρογύνων, ἀσθενῶν.
γυναικῶν καρδίας ἐχόντων. (<i>man-woman</i>: Dionysus,
<i>as both performing a man’s part and suffering a
woman’s</i>. Synonyms, “unmanly”, and “Hermaphrodite”.
Also of men-women, weakly men, having
the hearts of women.) Dionysus<a id="FNanchor_361_361" href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">361</a> then <i>performed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
the act of coition as a man, and suffered himself to
be used as a woman</i>, and for this reason was called
ἀνδρόγυνος (man-woman). We find the word used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
in the same way in <i>Plato</i><a id="FNanchor_362_362" href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">362</a>, in the passage of <i>Dio
Chrysostom</i> quoted a little above, in various places
in the <i>Writers on Physiognomy</i>, in <i>Philo</i>, loco citato,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
and in Artemidorus<a id="FNanchor_363_363" href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">363</a>. From the last we quote a
passage highly interesting for our purpose:</p>

<p>“A man saw in a dream his penis covered with
hair to the extreme tip, shaggy with very thick
hair that grew all of a sudden on it. He was a
notorious cinaedus, indulging in every abominable
pleasure, effeminate and a man-woman; only never
using his member as a <i>man</i> does. In this way
it happened that that part was so little employed,
that through not being rubbed against another
body hair actually grew on it.” The same author
relates in another place<a id="FNanchor_364_364" href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">364</a>:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span> “A man saw in a dream
the rôle<a id="FNanchor_365_365" href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">365</a> of a man-woman played on the stage;
<i>his privy member fell sick</i>. A man thought he saw
a priest of Cybelé (a castrated man); <i>his privy
member fell sick</i>. This happened in the first instance
because of the name, in the second because of
the coincidence of the fact with the spectator’s
condition. And indeed you know what κωμῳδεῖν
(to represent in comedy) signifies in dreams, and
what it means to see a priest of Cybelé. You
remember too that if any one dreams he sees a Comedy
or Tragedy and remembers it afterwards, the event
can be predicted according to the plot of the
piece dreamed of.”</p>

<p>The passage affords us yet another proof as to
the causes that were supposed in Antiquity to condition
the rise of diseases of the genitals, and we
need certainly feel no surprise if we find the ætiological
relations of these complaints even in professional
writers wrapped in all but impenetrable obscurity.</p>

<p>Now what <i>is</i> the word ἐναρέες? Some scholars
take it to be Greek; and accordingly would read<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
ἐναγέες (persons who have sinned against the godhead),
as <i>Bouhier</i> did, and perhaps <i>Caelius Rhodoginus</i>
even in his time, or else ανάριες (<i>imbelles, ad luctum</i>
veneream inepti,—unwarlike, i.e. unfit for the struggle
of love), which was <i>Coray’s</i> emendation. <i>Stark</i> does
not believe in any corruption of the word, but thinks
it should be derived from ἐναίρω (<i>spolio</i>,—I rob,
spoil), ἔναρα (<i>spolia</i>,—spoils), making it signify
<i>virilitate spoliati</i>,—men robbed of their virility. But
ἐναίρω according to <i>Buttmann’s</i> Lexilogus, p. 276.,
means “to send down to Hades”, to slay, ἔναρα
the spoils taken from the <i>slain</i>, and from this comes
the idea of spoliation, deprivation. The word
undoubtedly occurs (Homer, Iliad XXIV. 244.) in
the sense of “to be slain”, but the meaning <i>virilitate
spoliari</i> (to be deprived of virility) without the
addition of some supplemental word can certainly
not be authenticated in old Writers. Supposing this
derivation to be correct, ἐναρέες might signify simply
(Temple) robbers, and as a matter of fact the glosses
give ὁπλίται (warriors) as an explanation. It is a
surprising thing that those who make out the νοῦσος
θήλεια to have been gonorrhœa (clap), should not
have derived the word from ἐάρ, the sap, the seed,
with inserted ν.</p>

<p>However a Greek origin of the word is rendered
unlikely by one simple circumstance. <i>Herodotus</i>
writes τοὺς καλέουσι Ἐναρέας οἱ Σκύθαι, (whom
the Scythians call Ἐναρέες,—which is obviously the
same thing as saying, “in the language of the Scythians
they are called Ἐναρέες”. And again why
should <i>Herodotus</i> have explained it by ἀνδρόγυνοι
(men-women), if it was a word that every Greek
could understand. In this view moreover <i>Wesseling</i>
and <i>Schweighäuser</i>, scholars possessing a special,
critical knowledge of their Herodotus, concur. We
do not indeed know to what family of speech the
Scythian belongs; but it may be assumed that
the word signifying the disease took its origin from the
same country where the νοῦσος θήλεια itself arose.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
We believe ἐναρέες<a id="FNanchor_366_366" href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> to have been originally a
Syrian word, which the Scythians, or more likely
the Greeks<a id="FNanchor_367_367" href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">367</a>, first adopted into their own idiom. The
Greeks were particularly good at the transformation
or, if you please, distortion, of foreign names! The
word which we think must be claimed as the original
is the Semitic נַעֲרָה (<i>naãrâ</i>),—the <i>girl</i>, the <i>woman</i>
in the abstract; and we conjecture <i>Herodotus</i>
wrote ναρέες, a form which is actually found
according to <i>Coray</i> in one Manuscript. The
meaning then would be the <i>womanish</i> man,
and this gives a complete correspondance with
νοῦσος θήλεια and ἀνδρόγυνος. Another conjecture
is based on the name of the Babylonish Praefect or
Ἄνναρος, to which <i>Coray</i> calls attention, adding:
<i>mais qui pourroit bien être un surnom altéré par les
copistes, et relatif à sa vie effeminée et au milieu des
femmes</i>. (but which might very possibly be a surname<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
changed by the transcribers and referring to his
effeminate life and his living surrounded by women.)
In <i>Athenaeus</i><a id="FNanchor_368_368" href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">368</a> we read in fact: Κτησίας δ’ ἱστορεῖ,
<em class="gesperrt">Ἀνναρον</em> τὸν βασιλέως ὕπαρχον καὶ τῆς Βαβυλωνίας
δυναστεύσαντα στολῇ χρῆσθαι γυναικείᾳ
καὶ κόσμῳ· καὶ ὅτι βασιλέως δούλῳ ὄντι κ. τ. λ.
(Ctesias relates in his History that Annarus, the
King’s Praefect and Governor of Babylon wore a
woman’s robes and ornaments; and that being a
slave of the King, etc.) Still as a matter of fact
it is difficult to see <i>why</i> the transcriber should have
introduced the name as Ἄνναρος, the whole form
of the sentence demanding a proper name. <i>Coray</i>
refuses to admit that ἐναρέες is a foreign word at
all, for he says, “cette manière de s’exprimer n’est
souvent qu’une version littérale du mot étranger dans
la langue de l’écrivain qui l’emploie”. (such a mode
of expression is very often nothing more than a
literal translation of the foreign word into the
language of the writer using it). But if this were
the case, and the word one that a Greek would have
understood, why did <i>Herodotus</i> go out of his way
to explain it by ἀνδρόγυνοι? Supposing a transcriber
to have inserted Ἄνναρον into the text, yet even
then the word must have been familiar to him in
the sense of <i>womanish, unmanly</i>. But if it <i>has</i> this
meaning, Coray’s conjecture,—to read ἀναρέες for
ἐναρέες, should be unhesitatingly adopted,—if that
is (a point to which Prof. <i>Pott</i> has drawn attention)
the derivation is taken from Sanskrit or Zend.</p>

<p>In Zend in fact man is <i>nara</i>, woman <i>narî</i>; in
Sanskrit <i>nrî</i> is the stem, nom. <i>nâ</i>, pl. <i>nar-as</i>,—or
else <i>nara</i> the stem and nom. <i>naras</i>, from which has
come the Greek ἀνήρ (man) by addition of the
prosthetic, (not privative), α. Now from <i>nara</i>, by
prefixing α privative, which exists both in Zend and
Sanskrit, may be formed <i>a-nara</i>, with the meaning
of <i>not-man, unmanly</i>,—a meaning which is preserved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
in the name Ἄναρος (the doubling of the ν is
undoubtedly wrong); and so ἀναρέες would be
literally the same by etymology with Hippocrates’
ἀνανδριεῖς (unmanly men), occurring in a passage
to be presently discussed. This, and equally ἀνανδρία,
ἀνάνδρος (unmanliness, unmanly) are all expressions
for the pathic and his vice, as is shown
again and again by passages quoted in the course
of our investigation.</p>

<p>But again, if with <i>Coray</i> an actual verbal translation
of a foreign word is supposed, then ἀνανέρες
(ἀ-ν-ἀνέρες) might be read,—a word which though
quite legitimately formed, was not in actual use by
the Greeks, and for this reason <i>Herodotus</i> naturally
enough explained it by ἀνδρόγυνοι. In any case
the remarkable fact remains that no one of the ancient
Lexicographers, <i>Suidas</i> for instance or <i>Hesychius</i><a id="FNanchor_369_369" href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">369</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
should have thought the word, in whatever form
it may have been read, worthy of notice in his
Dictionary.</p>


<h4>§ 18.</h4>

<p>We have now, we think, adequately discussed the
νοῦσος θήλεια (feminine disease) in the preceding
Sections, and proved that the oldest view of all,
viz. that <i>the vice of the Pathic</i> must be understood
by that term, may be justified from every point of
view. It only remains to subject to examination
passages from such other authors as have employed
the expression. These <i>Stark</i>, §§ 11-18., has most
carefully collected. In this way we shall see how
far they may be brought into harmony with the
view adopted.</p>

<p><i>Philo</i><a id="FNanchor_370_370" href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">370</a> relates among a number of other evidences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
of the outspokenness of Diogenes the Philosopher,
when he was a captive and exposed for sale as a
slave, how his fellow-prisoners all stood sad and
cast down, but <i>he</i> again and again gave free course
to his witty humour. “For instance when he cast
his eye on one of the buyers, who suffered from
the <i>feminine disease</i>, he would seem to have gone up
to the man, whose outward appearance announced
him to be an <i>unmanly</i> man, and said: ‘Do you
buy me, for you seem to be in want of a
man!’ The buyer, conscious and ashamed, slunk
away among the crowd, whilst the bystanders
marvelled at Diogenes’ wit and boldness.”</p>

<p>In another place<a id="FNanchor_371_371" href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">371</a> <i>Philo</i> says, after having spoken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
of the Laws of Moses against harlotry: “Yet another
evil much more serious than the one mentioned,
has crept into states, <i>paederastia</i> to wit, the bare
naming of which was <i>formerly</i> an outrage. But
now it is a matter of boast, not only with those
who <i>practise</i> it, but also with the <i>pathics, the men
of whom it is customary to say,—They suffer from
feminine disease</i>. In fact they are effeminated in body
and soul, and not one spark of manliness do they
suffer to appear in them. They braid and deck
their hair to look like women, they smear and
paint their faces with ceruse and cosmetics and
such like things, anoint their persons with fragrant
ointments,—for a fragrant smell is an attraction
much sought after by such. Expending every
possible care on their outward adornment, they
are not ashamed even to employ every device <i>to
change artificially their nature as men into that of
women</i>. Against such it is right to be bloodthirsty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
obeying the Law, which commands: to slay,—and
fear no penalty,—the <i>man-woman</i> who transgresses
the law of nature, to let him live not a day, not
an hour,—shaming as he does himself, his family,
his country, nay! the whole race of mankind. The
<i>paederast</i> must endure the same penalty, for he
pursues after a pleasure that is contrary to Nature,
and, so far as in him lies, makes States desert and
empty of inhabitants, annihilating the begetting of
children. More than this he endeavours to entice
others and lead them away into two most abominable
vices, <i>unmanliness</i> and <i>effeminacy</i>, bedizening
youths (like women), and womanizing men in the
vigour of their age, just at the time when they
ought rather to be roused to aim at strength and
hardihood. In a word, like a bad farmer, he lets
the rich and fertile ploughland lie untilled, and makes
it unfruitful, but labours day and night where he
can expect no harvest whatever. Now this comes,
I think, from the fact that in most States prizes
are really offered for <i>incontinence</i> and <i>effeminacy</i>,—the
vices of the paederast and the pathic. At
any rate these men-women may be seen constantly
strutting in the <i>agora</i> at the hour of high market,
walking in procession at the sacred festivals, sharing,
unholy as they are, in holy offices, participating
in mysteries and sacrifices, even engaging in the
rites of Demeter. Some of them have brought the
charm of their youth to such a pass that <i>craving
a complete transformation into women, they have
amputated their generative members</i>; and now clad
in purple robes, as if they had wrought some
great benefit to their country, and surrounded by
a body guard, they enter in state, all eyes fixed
on them. Now if only such indignation as our
Lawgiver has expressed, were generally entertained
against those guilty of such effrontery, and if they
were banished, as expiating the common guilt of
their country, without appeal, this would do much
to improve many of their companions. The punish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>ment
of such as had been condemned, if in no
possible way to be shirked, would contribute no
little to checking any imitation of these lusts on
the part of others.”</p>

<p>In the third passage, <i>Philo</i><a id="FNanchor_372_372" href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">372</a> is speaking of the
difference between the <i>symposia</i> (banquets) of his
time and those of the Greeks, and says:—“The
Platonic banquet has to do almost entirely with
Love, but not the love of men for women, or of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
women for men,—for these are passions that are
satisfied conformably with the law of Nature,—but
the love of men whose affections are directed
to youths. For all the noble things that are said
besides about Eros (Love) and the heavenly Aphrodité
are to be taken as mere fine talk. By far
the most part in fact concerns Ἔρως κοινὸς and
Ἔρως πάνδημος (Common Love, Public Love),
which destroys all manliness, the virtue that is
most needful in war and peace, <i>infecting the mind
with the “feminine disease”, and turning men into
men-women</i>, whereas they should be equipped with
everything conducive to manly vigour. Instead of
this it ruins young men’s manliness, and gives
them the nature and character of a wanton; also
inflicting injury on the Lover in the most important
factors of life,—body, soul and property. For the
thoughts of the paederast must needs be all centred
on the boy he loves, and his gaze quick to see
that object only: while for all other concerns,
private or public, his eyes are blinded and useless,
and this especially if he is unhappy in his
love. His worldly condition takes hurt in two
ways, partly through neglect, partly through expenditure
on the loved one. Associated with this is
yet another, and a greater because general, mischief.
Such men bring about the depopulation of Cities, and
cause a lack of a good, sound strain of men, producing
barrenness and unfruitfulness. They resemble those
that are unskilful in husbandry, etc.”</p>

<p>In a fourth passage again, one overlooked however
by <i>Stark</i>, <i>Philo</i><a id="FNanchor_373_373" href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">373</a> says, speaking of the inhabitants of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
Sodom and their unbridled dissoluteness and vice:—</p>

<p>“For not only being mad after women did they
form disgraceful unions with strange women, but
actually, men as they were, they had intercourse
with males: they that practised the vice had no
shame for the sex they shared in common with
those that suffered it, but were guilty of wasting
their seed and disdaining the generation of offspring.
But conviction of guilt was of no avail to restrain
men mastered by an overpowering lust. Later,
learning by degrees the custom for such as were
born men yet to endure the treatment proper to
women, <i>they brought upon themselves feminine disease,
a curse they could in no wise contend against</i>. For
not merely womanizing their bodies by effeminacy
and wanton luxury, but utterly unsexing their very
souls, they destroyed, so far as in them lay, all
the manliness of their sex. In fact, if Greeks and
Barbarians had been unanimous and had all been
eager at once after such intercourse, the consequence
would have been to make every city
desolate, as though wasted by some pestilential
sickness.”</p>

<p>In the fifth and last passage of all <i>Philo</i><a id="FNanchor_374_374" href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">374</a> is
speaking of those whose entry into the sanctuary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
was interdicted by the Lawgiver: “He forbad all
that were unworthy to frequent, the Temple,
beginning <i>with the men-women, those that are sick
of the true (the feminine) disease</i>, who transgressing
the established law of Nature, <i>annex the lust and
looks of incontinent women</i>. He expelled all eunuchs,
those with strangled testicles and those with
amputated, who carefully safeguard the bloom of
youthfulness against decay, and transform the manly
type into a womanish shape. He expelled not only
harlots, but harlots’ children as well, etc.”</p>

<p>If we review systematically and in detail these
passages of <i>Philo</i>, given by <i>Stark</i> only in fragments,
any unprejudiced reader must see that there is not
one of them that does not refer to the vice of the
Pathic. As to the second and third passages <i>Stark</i>
himself (pp. 13 and 22.) admits this, while as to
the fourth we do not know what he thought, it
having been unknown to him: thus it is only in
relation to the <i>first</i> and <i>fifth</i> passages that we have
to examine his reasons for supposing this not to
be the case. After quoting the text and <i>Mangey’s</i>
Latin translation, <i>Stark</i> remarks à propos of the
<i>first</i> passage,—that dealing with Diogenes:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>—“Quin
hic verum corporis, nec animi vitium seu morbum
indicetur, quo laborantes virilitate orbarentur et
hanc suam impotentiam corporis habitu atque oris
specie proderent, nullus dubito. Nam hoc et verborum
series aperte declarat et ex eo colligi potest,
quod ille, qui hoc crimine tactum se sentiret, pudore
movetur.... Si vero Pathicorum labes, quam ab interpretibus
quibusdam hic suspicari video, ita intelligenda
esset, haec <em class="gesperrt">neque ex vultu coniici</em>
poterat <em class="gesperrt">neque a Graecis tam turpi macula
notabatur</em>, ut huic vitio deditis causa
esset, quam ab rem eius opprobrium effugerent.
Tantum enim abfuit, ut Pathici dedecus suum
occultarent, ut potius multo fastu atque pompa
prae se ferrent.... Verum autem Eunuchum genitalium
exsectione redditum his verbis significari,
non crediderim, quia hi neque inter licitatores,
sed potius inter vendendos reperiri, neque ob
harum partium defectum pudore tangi solerent.”
(I have no doubt whatever that a real fault of
body, and not of mind, in other words a disease,
is intended here,—a disease that robbed the sufferers
of virility, who then betrayed this impotence by the
condition and appearance of body and countenance.
This indeed is fully shown by the context, from
which it may also be gathered that the sufferer
who felt himself touched by this vice, has a feeling
of shame.... But if it is the taint of the pathics
that is to be understood here, as I see is conjectured
to be the case by some commentators, this taint
could not be guessed at from the face; nor yet
was it marked by the Greeks with so strong a
stigma of disgrace, as to cause those who were
given to it to strive to escape the opprobrium. For
so far were pathics from wishing to conceal their
shame, that they actually made a point of displaying
it ostentatiously.... On the other hand I should not
be inclined to suppose that a Eunuch, an actual
Eunuch by amputation of the genitals, is meant by
these words. These were hardly likely to be found
among the bidders, but rather with the slaves for
sale: nor were eunuchs accustomed to feel shame
on account of the loss of these organs.)</p>

<p>In § 16 above it has been abundantly proved
that the recognition of a pathic ἐκ τῆς ὄψεως, <i>ex
voltu</i>, (by the look), was a simple and familiar thing
with the Ancients, and especially so if we understand,
as is only reasonable, by ἐκ τῆς ὄψεως not merely
by the <i>face</i>, but by the whole appearance of the
person as well. We can only wonder at <i>Stark’s</i>
repeated denials of the existence of such external
marks of recognition, and all the more so, as every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
Text-book of Medical Jurisprudence making any
pretensions to complete detail (e.g. <i>Masius</i>, <i>Mende</i>)
gives information on the point. Again, it is proved
that paederastia was always regarded by the Greeks,
till the time when they lost their independence, as
a disgraceful vice,—the reason why the buyer spoken
of slunk away with a blush. As for the ostentatious
show of pathics, and particularly their importance
and the power they acquired, to which <i>Stark</i> refers
(p. 12. in his Note—28), this is only true for times
as late as <i>Philo’s</i> own, (he lived 40 A.D.), whereas
<i>Diogenes</i> appears in History in the middle of the
4th. Century B.C. <i>Stark</i>, again, cites as evidence the
words from the second passage: <i>Puerorum amor, de
quo vel loqui olim probrum fuit maximum, nunc laudi
ducitur</i>, (The love of boys, merely to speak of which
was formerly a deep disgrace, but which now is
made a boast),—without observing that his contention
as to paederastia not being held disgraceful in
Antiquity is most obviously contradicted by it.
Undoubtedly actual castrated eunuchs were not
meant, but the reasons <i>Stark</i> brings forward to
show this are without force, for he will hardly be
able to prove that in Asia the Castrated never
acquired importance and wealth, so as to be in a
position to buy themselves slaves. Further it may
be gathered that the man Diogenes addressed was
rich or held an important station from the fact
that the bystanders marvelled at Diogenes’ boldness
and outspokenness, a point that <i>Stark</i> indeed has
forgotten to mention. For <i>Philo’s</i> own times the
second passage is evidence enough. Equally do
we fail to see why a castrated eunuch would be unlikely
to blush, when the fact is thrown in his face.
<i>Stark</i> (p. 22) explains the νοῦσος θήλεια as <i>vitium
corporis</i> or <i>effeminatio interno morboso corporis statu
procreata</i>, (a fault of body, condition of effeminacy
produced by an internal morbid state of body).
Now if it were really this, how could he possibly
speak of the sufferers as <i>crimine tactos</i>, (touched by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
his <i>vice</i>)? They had nothing to be ashamed of,
unless indeed they had acquired the disease in a
shameful way, but this was not the case according
to his original assumption. This is confirmed by
<i>Clement of Alexandria</i>.<a id="FNanchor_375_375" href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">375</a></p>

<p>So far as the <i>fifth</i> passage is concerned, Stark
declares castrated eunuchs to be certainly intended,
and blames the editor of <i>Philo</i> (<i>Mangey</i>) for wishing
to read for ἀπὸ τῶν νοσούντων τὴν <em class="gesperrt">ἀληθῆ</em>
νόσον ἀνδρογύνων (with the men-women, those
that are sick of the <i>true</i> disease) τὴν <em class="gesperrt">θήλειαν</em>
νόσον (the <i>feminine</i> disease). He says in his note
30.: “<i>Mangetius</i> (a mistake for <i>Mangey</i>) reponit
θήλειαν. Quare hoc fieri, non dicam debeat, sed
ne oporteat quidem, non video. Nam νόσος
ἀνδρογύνων idem est, quod νόσος θήλεια. Si
igitur haec vox verbis superioribus adiiciatur, iners
atque inutilis appareat et pleonasmum vanum efficiat,
necesse est: τὸ ἀληθῆ contra, quod ille demit,
non vacuum ceteris additur verbum, ut eo perspicue
demonstraretur, hic <em class="gesperrt">verum morbum</em> seu <em class="gesperrt">illud
corporis vitium</em> esse intelligendum, quod
viros exsecando paritur, nec hanc animi labem,
qua contaminati solum muliebria patiuntur, quaequae
iisdem verbis nuncupatur, ut loci mox laudandi
docebunt.” (Mangetius restores θήλειαν—feminine.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
I cannot see why he should do this; in fact he
had no business to do so whatever. For νόσος
ἀνδρογύνων (disease of men-women) is the same
thing as νόσος θήλεια (feminine disease). So if
this expression is added on to the preceding words,
it can only appear redundant and useless and
make a silly pleonasm. Τὸ ἀληθῆ (the word <i>true</i>
disease) on the other hand is not otiose when added
to the other words. It shows distinctly that the
<i>true disease or notorious vitiation of body</i> was meant
to be understood, that which arises from castrating
men, and not merely the taint of mind that makes
the men whom it affects endure the treatment proper
to women, and which is called by the same name,—as
will be shown in passages to be cited presently.)</p>

<p>These last words evidently refer to the third
passage, where we read: Θήλειαν δὲ νόσον ταῖς
ψυχαῖς ἀπεργαζόμενος καὶ ἀνδρογύνους κατασκευάζων
(infecting the mind with feminine disease,
and turning men into men-women), for <i>Stark</i> himself
explains the νοῦσος θήλεια (feminine disease) as
being identical with the ἀνδρογύνων νόσος (disease
of men-women). So he is bound to explain this
sentence too as a <i>Pleonasmus vanus</i> (silly, useless,
pleonasm), for as a matter of fact those suffering
from νοῦσος θήλεια <i>are</i> men-women (ἀνδρόγυνοι).
But if a pleonasm is found in these latter words, it
is difficult to see why there should not be one
equally well in the fifth passage.</p>

<p>Yet for all he says, it is far from being demonstrated
that this pleonasm <i>is</i> useless and silly. The
sequence of thought is evidently this: Common Eros
(Love) infects the soul (ψυχή) with the νοῦσος
θήλεια, rousing the insatiable craving to play the
part of the woman, to be pathic in fact; and then,
this craving being indulged, the man becomes a
man-woman (ἀνδρόγυνος). As long as he goes on
practising the vice of the pathic, he is sick of the
νοῦσος θήλεια, and so it is perfectly correct to
speak of the νοῦσος θήλεια ἀνδρογύνων (feminine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
disease of men-women). A man-woman, that is a
person who suffers coition to be consummated with
him as with a woman, and concurrently also consummates
coition with women as a man, or at any
rate has the ability to do so,—this anyone may
quite well be, without suffering for all that from the
νοῦσος θήλεια. For instance he may be constrained
by force to be a pathic, or may regard it as a way
of earning money, like the male prostitutes of Greece
and Rome; and in that case has no interest further
in the vice of the pathic as such. On the other
hand if he is urged to it by <i>prurigo ani impudica</i>
(lascivious itch of the anus), this is sheer lubricity,
not to be expected in a sensible, healthy-minded
man. It can only be the consequence of a morbid
condition of temperament and body. Such a man
is the victim of νοῦσος θήλεια, the craving to be
a woman! This is just the position taken in the fifth
passage, as the subsequent words show quite plainly.</p>

<p>But granted that <i>Philo</i> actually wrote in this fifth
passage τὴν ἀληθῆ νόσον ἀνδρογύνων (the true
disease of men-women), would a bodily defect,
castration, be signified by the expression? Certainly
not. We could then take it in no other way but
this, “he began with the men-women, who suffered
from the true disease,” and should be constrained
to ask, “<i>what</i> disease?”,—a definite disease being
manifestly intended, as the addition of the definite
article (τὴν) shows. But this would imply that men-women
who were not suffering from this particular
disease were <i>not</i> excluded from visiting the Temple.
Yet most certainly <i>Philo</i> would never make any such
statement. However <i>Stark</i> translates with <i>Mangey</i>:
<i>Exorsus a vero semivirorum morbo laborantibus</i> that
is, “he began with those suffering from the true
disease of men-women”, from which it would follow
that there were other persons who suffered from
the <i>apparent</i> disease of the men-women, or no
reason exists for the special emphasis the definite
article gives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span></p>

<p>Really the question all along is not of castrated
persons at all, and cannot be, if the sense of the
whole passage is taken into account; for these
(castrated persons) are specially and separately
forbidden access to the Temple in the next sentence,—a
fact which nothing but the introduction into
the text of the conjunction γὰρ (for) by <i>Mangey</i>,
(following a MS. it is true), has obscured. The
words as they stand are  Θλαδιὰς [γὰρ] καὶ ἀποκεκομμένους
τὰ γεννητικὰ ἐλαύνει, (he expells all eunuchs,
those with strangled testicles, and those with amputated).
So if the men-women who suffered from
the νοῦσος θήλεια were actual eunuchs, this would
indeed be a <i>Pleonasmus vanus et ineptus</i> (silly and
idle pleonasm). <i>Stark</i> has evidently been led to
maintain the opinion he does, and to blame Mangey’s
emendation, which is in any case justified, by a
mistake as to the construction of the sentence. <i>Stark</i>
construed νοῦσον ἀνδρογύνων (disease of men-women),
whereas the construction requires: τὴν
ἄρχην ποιούμενος ἀπὸ ἀνδρογύνων, τῶν νοσούντων
τὴν θήλειαν (ἀληθῆ) νόσον (beginning with men-women,—those
that were sick of the feminine—true—disease),
the latter words being simply in
apposition to ἀνδρογύνων.</p>


<h4>§ 19.</h4>

<p>We now proceed to consider the passages from
the historian <i>Herodian</i> (170-240 A.D.). He relates<a id="FNanchor_376_376" href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">376</a>:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span></p>
<p>“Now he (Antoninus) had two generals, of whom
the one, an oldish man but stupid and quite unacquainted
with state affairs, was yet held to be a
good soldier; his name was <i>Adventus</i>. The other
who was called <i>Macrinus</i>, was not inexperienced
in forensic practice and possessed besides some
knowledge of law. Now the latter <i>Antoninus</i> frequently
assailed in public with gibes, saying he was
neither a soldier nor a man, going so for as positive
<i>insult</i>. For having heard that he led a somewhat
free life, and abominated scanty, rough eating and
drinking (in which <i>Antoninus</i> as a hardy soldier
took a pride), and wore a woman’s cloak or other
elegant raiment, he accused him of ἀνανδρία and
θήλεια νοῦσος (<i>unmanliness</i> and <i>feminine disease</i>),
and was constantly threatening to put him to death.
<i>Macrinus</i> could not endure such treatment and was
very much exasperated. And this was the result ...
etc.” Here ἀνανδρία and θήλεια νοῦσος (unmanliness
and <i>feminine disease</i>) are laid to <i>Macrinus’</i>
charge by <i>Antoninus</i> by way of insult, but it is not
in any way stated that he had become actually
impotent or Pathic. True ἀνανδρία (<i>unmanliness</i>)
is frequently used of the Pathic, but here it refers
simply to a womanish way of life in connexion
with eating and drinking, whilst the θήλεια νοῦσος
(<i>feminine disease</i>) is inferred from the female costume,
a thing in which, as we have seen, the Pathics
delighted<a id="FNanchor_377_377" href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">377</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span></p>

<p><i>Stark</i> indeed gives the following note on the
passage: “Ego quidem impotentiam virilem et illam
morbosam in sexum sequiorem degenerationem,
quae per animi mollitiem aeque ac per corporis
mutationem se prodit, hic accipiendam esse credo,
nec video, cur interpres labem illam qua muliebris
tolerantiae viri maculantur, intellectam velit.” (In
fact I consider we must take to be here meant
impotence and that morbid degeneration towards
the inferior sex which betrays itself at once by
effeminacy of mind and bodily deterioration; at the
same time I see no reason for a commentator
thinking that specific pollution to be signified whereby
men are affected who suffer themselves to be
treated as women.) However if only <i>Stark</i> had
chanced to read through the succeeding 13th. chapter
of <i>Herodian</i> as well, he would have found <i>Antoninus</i>
only meant to put upon the man an ordinary coarse
jest; for he there makes the very same reproach
against the Centurion <i>Martialis</i>, whose brother he
had had executed a few days previously; <span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>αὐτῷ τε
τῷ Μαρτιαλίῳ ἐνύβρισεν, <em class="gesperrt">ἄνανδρον αὐτὸν
καὶ ἀγεννῆ καλῶν</em> καὶ <em class="gesperrt">Μακαρίνου φίλον</em>,
(And he insulted Martialis himself, <i>calling him
unmanly and ignoble and a friend of Macarinus</i>.)
In any case the passage shows that even at that
period Paederastia was held to be dishonourable
and the name of Pathic involved an insult.</p>

<p>The Church Historian <i>Eusebius Pamphili</i> (264-340
A.D.) relates in his Life of <i>Constantine</i><a id="FNanchor_378_378" href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">378</a> that on a part
of the peak of Mount Lebanon stood a Temple of
Venus: “Therein was a school of vice for licentious
persons of every description, for all such as dishonoured
their bodies in various ways; womanish
men, that are no men at all, abrogated their natural
dignity and propitiated the goddess by θήλεια
νοῦσος (feminine disease); and again unlawful unions
of women, lecherous embraces, abominable and
abominated acts, were indulged in in this Temple,
as in a spot where neither law nor religion held
good. And there was no one to overlook their
doings, for no respectable man dared go near the
place.” Now to any one examining the whole drift
of the passage, it cannot for a single moment remain
doubtful that by θήλεια νοῦσος is here meant
some particular form of vice; and the words of the
text are such that, even if the expression only
occurred here and nowhere else at all, absolutely no
other meaning could be assigned to it but that of
the vice of the Pathic. We have already shown
that the words ἀκόλαστος (licentious person), πράξις,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
πράττειν (action, to act) are used of the Pathic,
whilst the phrase τὸ σεμνὸν τῆς φύσεως (natural
dignity) finds its explanation in the τὸ φύσεως
νόμισμα (custom of nature) of <i>Philo</i>, and γύννιδες
(womanish men) is interpreted in <i>Zonaras</i><a id="FNanchor_379_379" href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">379</a> by
ἀνδρόγυνος (man-woman), μαλακός (soft, effeminate),
and in Eustathius<a id="FNanchor_380_380" href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> by <span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>θηλυδρίας μὴ εὖ διακέιμενος
πρὸς τὰ ἀφροδίσια (womanish man, one not properly
behaved with regard to love),—meanings the real
force of which we have elsewhere verified, but which
most certainly are not to be taken as implying actual
castration, as <i>Stark</i> (§ 16) thinks. Indeed the last
named says, commenting on the passage of Eusebius:
“Haec verba non solum de mera morum atque
cultus mutatione muliebri rationi magis congrua,
intelligi posse, sed etiam per veram evirationem
genitalium truncatione confectam aptissime explicanda
esse, cum verborum series et Eustathii,
Hesychii ac Zonarae atque Valesii auctoritas me
suadet, tum multo magis illud monet, quod in
cultu Veneris virorum exsectionem solemnem fuisse
compertum habemus. Sin autem contenderis, viros
tales exsectos et effeminatos etiam muliebria passos
esse, ego quidem non repugno, exploratam vero
rem esse atque ratam, ex ipsis auctoris verbis non
liquet.” (That these words may be understood
not merely of a simple change of mode of life and
habit to one more closely assimilated to the female
type, but that they are most suitably to be explained
as implying an actual effemination of the individual
produced by amputation of the genitals, both the
context of the passage and the authority of Eustathius,
Hesychius, Zonaras and Valesius induces me
to believe, and still more am I led to this view by
the fact we already know, viz. that the castration
of men was customary in connection with the cult
of Venus. But if you further maintain that such
men so castrated and effeminated submitted to the
treatment proper to women, I do not deny it; I
only say that this point is not duly ascertained and
certified on the showing of the Author’s own words.)</p>

<p>Certainly we have already seen from the passage
of <i>Lucian</i> and from <i>Philo</i> that Paederastia supplied
a motive for the making of Eunuchs; but the passages
quoted from <i>Athanasius</i> and other Authors have
also taught us that the pollution of boys was carried
out in honour of Venus in her temples. As for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
<i>auctoritas Valesii</i> (authority of Valesius), <i>Stark</i> adds
in his notes (49): “Eandem vim his verbis tribuit,
ut ex interpretatione ejus Latina Eusebii videre est.
Histor. scriptor. ecclesiast. Paris 1677. fol. p. 211. B.”
(He assigns the same force to these words, as may
be seen from his Latin translation of Eusebius). To
our regret we are unable to refer to this edition,—which
it appears to us would have been a highly
desirable precaution; for the one which lies before us,<a id="FNanchor_381_381" href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">381</a>
a word for word, only more correct, re-impression
of the Paris edition, gives the version of Valesius
entirely in our sense: “Quippe effeminati quidam
et feminae potius dicendi quam viri, abdicata sexus
sui gravitate, <em class="gesperrt">muliebria patientes</em>, daemonem
placabant.” (Whereas certain effeminate men, that
should rather be called women than men, abrogating
the dignity of their sex, and suffering treatment
proper to women, used in this way to propitiate
their deity.) The same holds good of the translation
given by <i>Stark</i>: “Viri effeminati et non viriles,
naturae dignitatem ultro exuentes, <em class="gesperrt">morbo muliebri</em>
deam placabant.” (Effeminate men and
unmanly, of their own will putting off their nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
dignity, used to propitiate the goddess <i>with feminine
disease</i>.) Ought this to be taken as implying a claim
on his behalf to the translation generally as adduced by
him or merely to the rendering of the word γύννιδες
by <i>viri effeminati</i>? The previous authorities, <i>Eustathius</i>,
<i>Hesychius</i> and <i>Zonaras</i>, at any rate refer only to
γύννιδες, while <i>Stark</i> himself assigns it the meaning
of the <i>Vice of the Pathic</i> in the last words quoted.</p>

<p>Bishop <i>Synesius</i> (378-431 A.D.) in his Speech
<i>De Regno</i><a id="FNanchor_382_382" href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> addressed to the Emperor Arcadius
exhorts the latter to set bounds to the insubordination
in the army, and for the foreign subject peoples,
that are continually meditating treason, to attack
them and really conquer them, rather than wait
till their hostile temper break out in open revolt.
That the renown of the Romans stood fast, that
they were victorious, wherever they came and
marched through the countries of the world, like the
gods, supervising men’s insolence and government.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
“But those Scythians, Herodotus tells us so, and
we see it for ourselves, are all fallen under the
νόσος θήλεια (feminine disease). And it is they
of whom the subject peoples mainly consist, etc.”
He goes on to say how they had submitted only
in appearance, while secretly they laughed at the
folly of the Romans, who took their submission
seriously, etc. Now in the first place we must
remember the fact that <i>Synesius</i>, like all Greek
Orators and Fathers of later times, considered it
his special duty to cite the Classical Greek authors
as frequently as possible, and with this object made
almost any peg do to hang a quotation on. He
says of the Romans that they, ὡς Ὅμηρός φησι
τοὺς θεούς</p>

<p>
Ἀνθρώπων ὕβριν τε καὶ εὐνομίαν ἐφέποντες<br />
</p>

<p>(as Homer says of the gods, “visiting the insolence
and good government of men”), and to
explain this ὕβρις (insolence), he recalls the statement
of Herodotus to the effect that the Scythians suffered
from the νοῦσος θήλεια, a statement which, he adds,
still holds good of them; that the vice had prevailed
amongst them from the earliest times, that it was
quite inveterate, and that accordingly men of
such abandoned character could never be trusted,
trained as they were to dissemble; all this <i>Synesius</i>
is specially anxious to enforce strongly upon Arcadius!
In this sequence of thought we find a sufficient
explanation of the καὶ ἡμεῖς ὁρῶμεν (and we see
it for ourselves); this refers not so much to the
ocular recognition of the νοῦσος θήλεια, the possibility
of which however we have demonstrated
elsewhere, as to the fact that the disease was <i>still</i>
to be met with among the Scythians, in order to
show which Synesius laid special stress on the phrase,
and added—undoubtedly to the sacrifice of truth—the
word ἅπαντας (all of them). Besides which,
<i>Dionysius Petavius</i> reminds us in his notes on this
passage that the name “Scythian” is used here, as
it is in <i>Strabo</i>, in its widest signification, and includes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
Goths, Alani, Vandals, Germans, Huns, in fact all
the Northern peoples. This is the more interesting
as <i>Sextus Empiricus</i><a id="FNanchor_383_383" href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">383</a> relates of the Germans that
they practised Paederastia, Prof. <i>Meier</i> (loco cit.
p. 131. Note 20.), who cites the passage, doubted
the truth of the statement, on the ground that
Sextus Empiricus is the only author, and even he
does so only as a matter of hearsay (ὡς φασιν—as
men say), to lay this vice to the charge of the
Germans, whose purity of morals is not impugned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
by any other Writers. But surely he did not take
into consideration that Sextus Empiricus lived about
200 years after Christ, and is speaking of the Germans
of his own times, not of the old Germans such as
<i>Tacitus</i> and <i>Caesar</i> knew them. It is hardly likely
the Germans of Sextus’ and Synesius’ day should
have entirely escaped the universal degeneracy of
all Nations; and again, with what object did German
Emperors at a later date promulgate laws against
the vice of Paederastia, Sodomy, etc., if it did not
exist among their people?</p>

<p><i>Clement of Alexandria</i>, after speaking of the objectionable
character of the worship of the different
gods of the Heathen, goes on to relate as follows<a id="FNanchor_384_384" href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">384</a>:</p>

<p>“All blessings befall that King of the Scythians,
whatever his name may have been, who when one
of his subjects copied the service of the Mother of
the gods usual among the people of Cyrené, beating
the drum and clashing the cymbals hung at his
neck, and dedicating himself as a Menagyrtes (Priest
of Cybelé), shot him dead, as a man who had been
made <i>no man</i> (ἄνανδρος) among the Greeks, and
as a teacher of the <i>feminine disease</i> (νόσος θήλεια)
to the rest of the Scythians.” <i>Herodotus</i><a id="FNanchor_385_385" href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">385</a> who tells
the same story, calls the King Saulius and the
offending citizen Anarcharsis<a id="FNanchor_386_386" href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">386</a>, but makes no mention,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
any more than do <i>Diogenes Laertius</i> and <i>Philo</i><a id="FNanchor_387_387" href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">387</a>, of
the θήλεια νοῦσος (feminine disease). Accordingly
we must evidently regard this as an <i>addition</i> on
the part of Clement of Alexandria, who judging
from his own times, when the Priests of Cybelé
universally practised paederastia with each other,
and in order to further lay stress on the fact that
the Scythian king had done right in killing the
man who was introducing a heathen, and besides
an exceedingly licentious, form of worship, felt no
hesitation in making the addition. And as a matter
of fact, how widely paederastia prevailed in the time
of Clement of Alexandria, and how intimately he was
acquainted with it, is proved by the passages quoted
on previous pages from his writings. <i>Stark</i> prefers here
also to understand a <i>vera eviratio</i> (true effemination),
i.e. that they were actually castrated, maintaining that
this was the case with the priests of Cybelé, whilst
<i>Larcher</i> considers merely the womanish cult of the
<i>Dea Mater</i> (Goddess Mother) to be indicated.</p>

<p>The last passage in which the expression θήλεια
νοῦσος (feminine disease) occurs, is a <i>scholion</i> on the
word γαλλιαμβικὸν (viz. μέτρον—galliambic metre)
in <i>Hephaestion</i><a id="FNanchor_388_388" href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">388</a>. The Scholiast says: Γαλλιαμβικὸν
δὲ ἐκλήθη, ἐπεὶ λελυμένον ἐστὶ τὸ μέτρον· οἱ δὲ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
Γάλλοι, διαβάλλονται ὡς <em class="gesperrt">θήλειαν νόσον</em>
ἔχοντες, διὸ καὶ σώματα φόρον ἐτέλουν Ῥωμαίοις
εἰς τοῦτο· οἱ τοιοῦτοι δέ ἱερεῖς εἰσὶ Δήμητρος.
(Now it was called galliambic, because the metre is
loose; and the Galli are evil spoken of as having
<i>feminine disease</i>. Wherefore also they used to pay
their bodies as tribute to the Romans—<i>or</i>, their
bodies used to pay tribute to the Romans—to this
day; and such men are priests of Demeter.) <i>Stark</i>
gives (p. 21.) the following translation of this. “Galliambicum
vocabatur, quod solutum est metrum;
Galli enim utpote <em class="gesperrt">morbo muliebri</em> laborantes
inculpantur, quod Romanis corpora ad hoc (tanquam)
tributum persolverent,” (It was called galliambic,
because the metre is loose; for the Galli are accused
as suffering from <i>feminine disease</i>, inasmuch as they
used to pay their bodies to the Romans to this day
as it were a tribute),—but without committing himself
to any more precise explanation of the words. The
meaning of the first two sentences is plain enough:
The metre is called the galliambic, because it is
loose, resolved, i. e. instead of long syllables short
are used, and so the metres changed from masculine
to feminine. Now the Galli are charged with practising
θήλεια νόσος (feminine disease) (as <i>Homer</i>,
Odyssey I. 368., says: ὑπέρβιον ὕβριν ἔχοντες—having,
practising very audacious insolence). But
what do the words that follow mean: διὸ καὶ σώματα
φόρον ἐτέλουν Ῥωμαίοις εἰς τοῦτο? The
<i>tanquam</i> (as it were) added in the Latin translation
shows that the translator took the sentence in a
figurative sense. But what is the subject of the
sentence? is it σώματα or Γάλλοι—ἔχοντες?
The translator must necessarily have taken the latter
as the subject: “wherefore they paid or offered up
their bodies to the Romans as it were for tribute”;
and this could imply nothing less than that the Galli<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
gave themselves up to the Romans as Pathics. Now
does the arrangement of the words admit of this?
We think not; for in that case the Scholiast must
needs have put ἑαυτῶν with σώματα or at any
rate the article τὰ.</p>

<p>Therefore if we take the sentence literally and
regard σώματα as being the subject, it reads:
“wherefore also the bodies (of the Galli) were subject
to tax to the Romans to this day.” We have seen
already how the word τέλος signified among the
Greeks the “prostitution tax,” and how the Septuagint
translators rendered the Hebrew קְדֵשָׁה (Kêdeshah)
and קָדֵשׁ (Kâdesh), by which names the Priests of
Cybelé were understood, by τελεσφόρος and τελισκόμενος
(subject to tax, paying tax), how the Priests
of Cybelé are characterised by other writers as men
who were Pathics in honour of their goddess, and
how as a matter of fact the <i>Cinaedi</i> or <i>Exoleti</i> at
Rome in the time of the Emperor Severus had
to pay an impost similar to the prostitution-tax.
The <i>scholion</i> then shows us that the Galli also
were subjected to this impost payable to the State.
Were it a question merely of Castrated persons
or indeed of anything else but actual Paederastia,
the whole <i>scholion</i> would be unintelligible; yet
<i>Stark</i> maintains that simply Eunuchs are intended,
and this because of the words that are appended,
to the effect that the Galli were Priests of Demeter.
No doubt they may have been castrated, but this
is a side issue; the important point is, that they
were Pathics.</p>

<p>Finally we have still a passage from <i>Dio Chrysostom</i><a id="FNanchor_389_389" href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">389</a>
to mention, in which however the hitherto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
almost stereotyped expression θήλεια νόσος (feminine
disease) is exchanged for γυναικεία νόσος (womanly
disease). The author is here expounding how all
acts are under the governance of a definite Genius or
Spirit, and says: “for a weakling and faint-hearted
Spirit of this sort leads readily to the γυναικεία νόσος
(womanly disease) and other shames, to which is
attached punishment and disgrace.” Then in the
following sentences the life and appearance of one
governed by this Spirit are more exactly described,
in such a way that there can be no possibility of
supposing anything else to be intended than the
vice of the Pathic, and even <i>Stark</i> (p. 12.) admits
this much.</p>

<p>On reviewing once again what has been said,
we find that the Scythians in Asia became acquainted
with paederastia, when Pathics returned from foreign
lands, and henceforth practised the vice at home
as well. Their fellow-countrymen could only suppose
an evil demon animated them. So when at length
as a natural result of their vice they fell sick in
body and in mind, when nervous disorders and
imbecility visited the unfortunates, they never for
a moment ascribed this to the vice these men
practised, but rather regarded their condition as a
consequence of the avenging wrath of Venus, whose
temple they had robbed, and thus brought into
connection an earlier incident and a later.</p>

<p>When the Greek became acquainted with the vice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
he of course shared at first the notion of the avenging
action of a deity, but he directed his attention less
to the consequences of this vice, which in Greece
were generally slighter, than to the Vice itself, which
robbed the man of his manly characteristics and
normal activity, and drove him to take on him the
rôle of the woman in exchange for that of the man.
But to be a woman was invariably among all nations
a disgrace for the man, whom <i>Plato</i> (Timaeus 42.)
considered the γένος κρεῖττον (superior sex), while
<i>Aristotle</i> not merely represents the woman as owing
her existence to an ἀνάγκη (unavoidable necessity),
but calls her an ἄῤῥεν πεπηρωμένον (crippled male),
an ἀναπηρία φυσική (natural crippling), even a
παρέκβασις τῆς φύσεως (aberration of nature)<a id="FNanchor_390_390" href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">390</a>.
But no man of sound intellect could possibly suffer
himself to be used as a woman; therefore he must
needs be sick, be afflicted with a disease that
assimilated him to a woman (θήλεια—feminine).
When <i>Herodotus</i> wrote, the Greeks to be sure knew
the vice which was practised with <i>boys</i> (Paederastia)
or youths, who had not yet reached man’s estate,
but these were always first corrupted by adults;
they did not practise the vice of their own impulse
and could not as a rule be held accountable. When
however they saw adults, men who were already
in possession of manly prerogatives, appear as Pathics—not
merely boys and youths not yet capable of
the procreative act,—they could in no way explain
the phenomenon to their satisfaction except by
supposing them to have been attacked by a disease
that changed them into women<a id="FNanchor_391_391" href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">391</a>. This also gives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
the reason why the expression νοῦσος Θήλεια
(feminine disease) occurs so seldom in the Greek
writers, for it was the violation of boys, not the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
violation of <i>men</i>, that was a familiar fact to them.
For in the fact that the beautiful form of a boy
was capable of firing a sensual longing to enjoy it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
the Greek saw nothing at all unnatural; and he
found excuses for the momentary forgetfulness of
self-respect on the part of the paederast, as he did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
in the case of the boy or youth. But if there had
been seduction, then the offence was strongly reprobrated,
unless the Pathic had been a slave.</p>

<p>Neither bodily nor psychical consequences of the
vice of the Pathic ever attained in Greece, as has
been said, any very high degree of development;
and most of the characteristic marks of the <i>Cinaedus</i>
were regarded as artificial, worn half intentionally
by him for show. Even in his peculiar gait, voice
and look, the Greeks saw more an invitation to the
perpetration of the vice than anything else; and
if <i>Plato</i> denies to this class of persons the wish for
natural coition, this is rather a sign how completely
the vice mastered them than a proof of the annihilation
of their power to procreate at all.</p>

<p>Even when positive diseases did actually occur in
consequence of the vice, public opinion was far
from ascribing these to the vice itself; nervous and
mental affections were regarded as a punishment
from the gods, or else they were treated according
to their several symptoms without any examination
into the original cause. Bodily ailments, especially
if they did not affect the posterior or penis, were
set down to any cause but the true one, often to
quite ridiculous ones. The νοῦσος θήλεια (feminine
disease) was invariably thought of merely as a form
of vice dependent on a morbid imagination, while
its consequences as such were left entirely out of
consideration. <i>Nam neque ulla curatio corporis depellendae
passionis causa recte putatur adhibenda, sed
potius animus coercendus, qui tanta peccatorum labe
vexatur</i>, (For the right opinion is this: no bodily
treatment should be applied in order to expel the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
complaint, rather should the mind be disciplined
that is vexed by so foul a stain of sinful indulgences),
are the words of <i>Coelius Aurelianus</i> in the passage
quoted on page 159.</p>

<p>From this it is evident the later enquirers quoted
above could take the νοῦσος θήλεια (feminine
disease) for a purely mental affection, and be right
in a sense,—but a sense that certainly never entered
into their heads to consider. For they looked upon
the intellectual imbecility that resulted from the vice
of the Pathic as being the essence of the νοῦσος
θήλεια (feminine disease), and the bodily derangements
as merely secondary and dependent on the
psychica disturbances. Thus to some extent they
confounded cause and effect, putting one for the
other; yet without hitting on the true explanation,
against which the meritorious <i>Stark</i> has tried so hard
not perhaps to shut his eyes, but rather to forcibly
remove it in any possible way out of the range of
his ideas. For this very reason it has pursued him
from beginning to end of his investigations, and in
spite of all his struggles has found at last a reluctant
and partial recognition from him.</p>

<p>As to the remaining views cited above, no attentive
reader surely needs any further confutation of these.</p>


<h4>§ 20.</h4>

<p>We have now, we think sufficiently, proved that
<i>Herodotus</i> as well as the other writers who use the
expression νοῦσος θήλεια (feminine disease), denoted
by it merely a <i>Vice</i>, which lent a feminine character
to the behaviour and indeed to the whole look and
mode of life of a man, assimilating him equally in
body and in mind to the woman. Throughout the
enquiry we have kept our eyes fixed on the <i>cause</i>
of this transformation; and we shall now find it easy
to estimate the value of a passage of <i>Hippocrates</i>,
originally brought forward by <i>Mercurialis</i> (loco citato,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
p. 143. Note 10.) later by <i>Zwinger</i><a id="FNanchor_392_392" href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">392</a> and others,
but which <i>Stark</i> in particular has characterised as
<i>a more complete delineation of the disease, merely pointed
out and named νοῦσος θήλεια (feminine disease) by
Herodotus</i>. On the other hand <i>Bouhier</i> specially
and strenuously denies the identity of the two, yet
without accurately recognising the true relationship.</p>

<p>Hippocrates in his well-known Work on <i>Air,
Water and Environment</i>, describes the country of the
Scythians as a bare but well-watered tableland, with
so cold and damp a climate that a heavy mist
covered the fields all day long and only a short
summer was enjoyed. The inhabitants he says are
arrogant, puffed up and exceedingly idle creatures,
in outward look and mode of life having little
distinctly marked characteristics of sex, the men
having only very moderate desire for coition, and
the women, whose menstruation is less frequent,
possessing little capacity for conception. Then he
goes on<a id="FNanchor_393_393" href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">393</a>: “Moreover there are very many men
amongst the Scythians resembling Eunuchs (εὐνουχίαι);
these not only follow women’s occupations
(show feminine inclinations, behave as women?—γυναικεῖα
ἐργάζονται) just like the women, but
also bear a name signifying this, for such men are
called No-men (ἀνανδριεῖς). The natives ascribe
the cause to a deity; they are afraid of these men,
and show them a slavish respect (προσκυνέουσι<a id="FNanchor_394_394" href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">394</a>),
though each individual dreads such a fate for himself.
It seems to me that affections of this sort may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
be said to have come from a deity to exactly the
same degree as all other diseases,—no single one is
more than any other in a sense of divine origin.
Each one of them has its own peculiar nature, and
nothing happens outside its nature. Now how these
affections arise in my opinion, I will proceed to
state. From constant riding they get κέδματα<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span><a id="FNanchor_395_395" href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">395</a>
(varicose dilatations), because their feet always hang
away from the horse. Hence they become lame,
and get, those that are seriously ill, ulcers on the
hips (in the region of the <i>ischium</i>, festering of the
<i>cotyla</i> or joint-socket?<a id="FNanchor_396_396" href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">396</a>). Then they treat themselves
with a view to cure in the following fashion. So
soon as the complaint breaks out, they open their
veins on either side of the ear; then when the blood
has flowed, they fall asleep from weakness, and go
on sleeping till they wake, some of them cured and
some of them not. But it appears to me that by
such a treatment they ruin themselves<a id="FNanchor_397_397" href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">397</a>. For there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
lie near the ears certain veins, and when these are
severed, the men so cut become seedless (unfruitful);
and it is these veins that, <i>as I think</i>, they sever.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
But when subsequently they approach women, and
find themselves in no condition to use them (to
consummate coition with them), at the first they are
not discouraged, but keep quiet. However later,
after they have tried twice, three times, or oftener,
with no better success, they believe themselves to
have sinned against the deity, whom they hold to
be to blame, put on a woman’s frock, and acknowledge
their unmanliness (ἀνανδρίην), behave as women,
and in company with the women perform the same
tasks as they do. The like of this however happens
only to the rich Scythians, not to the poor, in fact
to the nobler classes and such as have attained to
some considerable wealth, to a smaller degree to
those of lesser position, because these latter do
not ride.</p>

<p>But surely the complaint, since it is above all
others of divine origin, must attack not solely the
noblest and richest Scythians, but all equally,—or
even to a greater extent those who possess little,
and therefore fail to make offerings; if that is to say
the gods take pleasure in (active) veneration on the
part of men and see that they win a due return
for it<a id="FNanchor_398_398" href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">398</a>. For naturally the rich offer much to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
gods, bring correspondingly great contributions from
their goods as marks of their veneration; but the
poor less, because they possess nothing. Then are
these discontented, because they have given them
no wealth; so that those who possess little suffer
more of the punishments for such faults than the
rich. But as a matter of fact, as I have said before,
these things come from the deity to just the same
degree as the others; for everything happens in
accordance with nature, and so does this affection
arise among the Scythians from the original cause
I have pointed out. Now it is precisely the same
among the rest of mankind; where riding is practised
most and most continuously, there very many suffer
from κέδματα (varicose dilatations), hip and foot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
affections, and accomplish coition very badly (are
only slightly disposed to coition). And this is the
case with the Scythians, and they are of all men
most like eunuchs, for the following reasons: Because
they always wear trousers, and besides that pass the
greatest part of their time on horseback, so that
they cannot touch the genitals with the hand, through
cold and lassitude forget the desire for coition and
coition itself, and (in their senseless infatuation) think
of nothing else but how to resign their manly
privilege<a id="FNanchor_399_399" href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">399</a>. This is an account of how it is with the
stock of the Scythians.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span></p>

<p>Now if we separate the facts which are brought
forward in this passage of Hippocrates from his
attempted explanations, there can be no doubt that
the same thing is in question here as that which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
Herodotus describes. There are men amongst the
Scythians who behave as women, speak as women,
perform women’s work and keep with the women, and
their condition the Scythians consider as something
sent by the deity, and for this reason honour and
fear these men. All the rest is part of the attempted
explanations of the author, who brings together every
possible consideration in order to discover a natural
cause of the phenomenon, leaving utterly and
entirely unrecognized all the time the most natural
cause of all. This of course was due to no other
reason except that it was <i>unknown</i> to him, and that
he was acquainted with the circumstances not from
his own observation, but only from hearsay. This
is a conjecture which <i>Heyne</i> (<i>loco citato</i>) had already
made in his time, but which has met with many
opponents, yet without the argument having ever
been properly brought to the test of the evidence.
In favour of Heyne’s view a passage from the book
περὶ ἄρθρων (On Joints)<a id="FNanchor_400_400" href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> might be cited, in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
the limping of the men of the Amazons in consequence
of the dislocation of the limbs is clearly
declared to be an unauthenticated myth; for which
reason <i>Gruner</i><a id="FNanchor_401_401" href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">401</a> denied Hippocrates’ authorship of
this work in opposition to the general witness of
Antiquity.</p>

<p>But really and truly we are as well without the
passage; for if what he relates were the result of
his own observation, how could the author write in
connexion with his remark that the Scythians bled
themselves behind the ears, ταύτας τοίνυν <em class="gesperrt">μοι
δοκέουσι</em> τὰς φλέβας ἐπιτάμνειν (now these are
the veins, <i>as it seems to me</i>, that they cut)? Is the
actual fact possibly, that all these attempted explanations
flowed from the pen of some later, or of
several later, writers? At any rate for ourselves, we
have never yet been able to get rid of a suspicion
to that effect. But be this as it may, so much at
least is certain, as was stated above; viz. that the
Author was unacquainted with the actual cause of
attempts to explain it, probably from misunderstanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
the effemination of the Scythians, and that all
of the words ἀνανδρίες and εὐνουχίαι (unmanly,
eunuch-like), aim at referring the loss of the generative
power, i.e. ἀνανδρία in its strict sense, to some
natural reason, while the effemination is looked upon
merely as a secondary circumstance.</p>

<p>That Hippocrates was not, any more than the later
Physicians of antiquity, fully and exactly acquainted
with the consequences of the vice of the Pathic as
affecting the body, we see from the following passage,
appearing in an exceedingly corrupt form in the text
of Foesius<a id="FNanchor_402_402" href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">402</a>: εὐνοῦχος ἐκ κυνηγεσίης καὶ διαδρομῆς
ὑδραγωγὸς γίνεται· ὁ παρὰ τὴν Ἐλεαλκέος κρήνην·
ὁ περὶ τὰ ἓξ ἄτεα <em class="gesperrt">ἱππουρίν</em> τε καὶ βουβῶνα
καὶ <em class="gesperrt">ἴξιν</em> καὶ κέδματα· ὁ τὸν <em class="gesperrt">κενεῶνα</em> φθινήσας
ἑβδομαῖος ἀπέθανεν, <em class="gesperrt">προπιούντων ἄπεπτον</em>,
ἁλμυρὰ μετὰ μέλιτος· <em class="gesperrt">πορνείη ἄχρωμος</em>
δυσεντερίης ἄκος. (a eunuch by hunting or running
becomes dropsical; he that is beside the fountain
of Elealces; he that about six years [suffered from]
“<i>horse-tail</i>” [a disease of the groin due to too much
riding], swelling of the groin, <i>varicocele</i> and dilatations;
he that was sick in the <i>flank</i> died the seventh day,
when they were about to administer a raw drink,
salt liquid with honey; inordinate fornication is a
cure for dysentery.??) All editors of Hippocrates
have been especially scandalized by the connection
in which πορνείη ἄχρωμος (inordinate fornication)
stands in this passage; only <i>Foesius</i> defended it,
referring to other passages in <i>Aëtius</i><a id="FNanchor_403_403" href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> and <i>Paul of
Aegina</i><a id="FNanchor_404_404" href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">404</a>, in which coition is recommended in chronic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
diarrhœa as drying up the humours. This he might
equally well have established from Hippocrates
himself, for the latter says (Epidem. bk. VI. sect. 5.
note 29.), λαγνεία τῶν ἀπὸ φλέγματος νούσων
ὠφέλιμον (lasciviousness is advantageous in diseases
that arise from phlegm) and (note 26.), μίξις τὰ
κατὰ τὴν γαστέρα σκληρύνει (sexual intercourse
hardens the contents of the belly)]<a id="FNanchor_405_405" href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">405</a>. However this
holds good only of the man who performs coition,
inasmuch as the effusion of semen compels the body
to supply what is lost, and this can only be done
at the cost of other secretions, and so must stop
the flow of any morbid secretions as well to a greater
or less degree. But the question here is not of the
coition the man performs, but of that which he
suffers another to perform on him, in fact the vice
of the Pathic, as the word (fornication) clearly shows;
and that Pathics have habitually a pallid complexion
has been already mentioned (p. 144).</p>

<p>To bring some sort of sense into the passage
quoted above, <i>Mercurialis</i> would read πόρνη ὡς
ἄχρωμος (like a shameless harlot), <i>Dacier</i> πορνείη
ἄχρωμον ἄκος, (fornication is a shameless remedy ...)
and <i>Richard Mead</i> προῤῥοὴ ἄχρωμος (an inordinate
effusion). But <i>Triller</i><a id="FNanchor_406_406" href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">406</a> was the first to come to the
conclusion that the words were in the wrong order,
and emends the sentence thus: <span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>ὁ τὸν <em class="gesperrt">αἰῶνα</em>
φθινήσας, <em class="gesperrt">πορνείῃ</em> ἄχρωμος, ἑβδομαῖος ἀπέθανεν,
<em class="gesperrt">προϊόντων ἀπέπτων</em>. Ἁλμυρὰ μετὰ
μέλιτος δυσεντερίης ἄκος, (he that destroyed his
life and vigour, being inordinate in fornication, died
on the seventh day, undigested matters coming from
him. Salt drinks with honey are a remedy for
dysentery). This certainly makes it more readable,
particularly if πορνείη ἄχρωμος is put <i>before</i> ὁ τὸν
αἰῶνα, inasmuch as the pallid complexion was
undoubtedly a forerunner of phthisis. His reasons,
which we beg the reader to peruse for himself in
the author’s work, are at any rate to us so convincing
that we do not hesitate a moment to adopt
his emendations. These have unfortunately hitherto
gone entirely unnoticed; for <i>Grimm</i>, who appears
to have taken no exception to the passage generally,
has translated entirely in accordance with the old
text, and not added any note at all. The same is
the case with <i>Lilienhain</i>, who has more recently
gone over the same ground again; though both have
restored instead of κενεῶνα (belly) αἰῶνα (life)
previously conjectured by <i>Foesius</i>.</p>

<p>Granted that by these means the last sentence is
made intelligible, and justice done Hippocrates by
no longer making him recommend coition as a remedy
against dysentery, still the preceding sentence likewise
stands in need of correction. For ἴξιν obviously
ἰξίαν or ἰξίας (varicosities) must be read, which
indeed was done by former translators, and long ago
suggested by Foesius; but as to ἱππουρίν, no sufficient
account has ever yet been given by any
editor. The word appears to us to be corrupt, and
to have got into the text owing to the fact that in
the Manuscript, instead of προπιούντων,—which
indeed no single Codex has, the majority reading
ὑποπνοιούντων, there stood in the next line
ὑποπορούντων, ὑποῤῥυόντων or ὑπποῤῥεόντων.
<i>Cornarius</i> read, περὶ ἓξ ἔτεα <em class="gesperrt">ἐξ ἱππασίης</em>
βουβῶνα, ἰξίας, κ. τ. λ. (for about six years, <i>in
consequence of riding</i>, inguinal swellings, varicosities,
etc.), but without assigning his reasons; in all probability
however he made this conjecture, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
does not commend itself at any rate to us, with the
passage about the Scythians in his mind’s eye.</p>

<p>But we can only arrive at a probable emendation
on the condition that we correctly estimate the
sequence of the sentences as a whole. If we are
not greatly mistaken, it is as follows: First of all
the question is of a Eunuch who became dropsical;
then in connection with this, the <i>rest</i> is added
applying to <i>another Eunuch</i>. In the Book περὶ γονῆς
(Of the Seed), (Vol. I. p. 273. K.) we read: οἱ δὲ
εὐνοῦχοι διὰ ταῦτα οὐ λαγνεύουσιν, ὅτι σφέων
ἡ δίοδος ἀμαλδύνεται τῆς γονῆς—αὕτη δὲ ἡ
δίοδος ὑπὸ τῆς τομῆς <em class="gesperrt">οὐλῆς</em> γενομένης στερεὴ
γέγονεν. (Now Eunuchs are not lascivious, because
in them the passage of the seed is wasted away,...
and this passage has become hardened by the wound
where they were cut getting <i>skinned over but festering
within</i>). Now we might well be tempted to read in
the text: ὁ περὶ τὰ ἓξ ἔτεα ὑπὸ τῆς τομῆς οὐλῆς
καὶ βουβῶνα, that is to say, the man suffered for
six years in consequence of the skinning over of the
cut from swelling in the groin, etc. However this
could hardly be justified, and we think it much
better to join ὑπὸ and οὐλῆς and either to read
ὕπουλος, ὑπουλῶς or ὑπουλὴν περὶ τὰ βουβῶνα,
that is, he had had for six years festering places in
the inguinal region,—which idea possibly Calvus
may have had in his mind, or else ὑπουλήν τε καὶ
βουβῶνας, he had had for six years festering places
(fistulas), inguinal swellings, etc., or finally, what
might seem the best of all, ὕπουλον βουβῶνα, a
festering inguinal region<a id="FNanchor_407_407" href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">407</a>. In the <i>De morbis mulierum</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
(On the Diseases of Women), bk. I., edit Kühn,
Vol. II. 680. we read, ὀδύνη ἔχει καὶ τὰς ἰξύας
καὶ τοὺς κενεῶνας καὶ τοῦς βουβῶνας (pain holds
both the loins and belly and the inguinal regions),—so
we might perhaps similarly read here, ὕπουλον
(ἔχει) καὶ βουβῶνα καὶ ἰξύα καὶ κενεῶνα καὶ
κέδματα, πορνείη ἄχρωμος, φθινήσας κ. τ. λ.
(he has in a festering condition both inguinal region
and loin and belly and also varicosities, being inordinate
in fornication, in pain etc.), which would give
κέδματα the meaning of <i>Varices</i> (varicosities), and
the sense of the whole passage would then be as
follows: “A Eunuch in consequence of hunting and
running became dropsical; another at the fountain
of Elealces, who for six years had had festering
(fistulous) ulcers in the inguinal region, the loins and
in the region of the <i>os sacrum</i>, as well as varicosities,
had grown pallid and suffered wasting through
indulgence in the vice of the pathic, died, after
making involuntary evacuations, to counteract which
he had taken salt with honey, a usual remedy against
dysentery, on the seventh day.”</p>

<p>Be this as it may, at any rate it is shown very
distinctly by the passage that its author was but very
slightly acquainted with the consequences resulting
from the vice of the Pathic, for he ascribes to it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
nothing but the pallidness of complexion, whereas
the whole series of morbid symptoms might very
well have been due to it (Comp. p. 180.). Certainly
the Author is to be excused, for as a rule the bodily
consequences resulting from the vice of the Pathic
were in Greece very slight and of rare occurrence,
neither did the vice in that country reach anything
like such a height. Again among the pastoral
Scythians, whose racial character in other respects
was but little marked, the local bodily consequences
fell rather into the background, while the assimilation
of the whole person to the female type occurred the
more readily; but at the same time stood out all
the more glaringly conspicuous to the eyes of a
foreign observer, as he had noted nothing to correspond
at home. Thus it was easy for him to be
misled in considering the marvellous phœnomenon
into forgetting its real origin, which no doubt was,
in seeming, somewhat remote; and was apt to think
of any other cause rather than the vice of the pathic,
the consequences of which even distinguished
Physicians of more modern times failed adequately to
appreciate. Is it for us to throw a stone on these
grounds at Hippocrates and his contemporaries?</p>

<p>In confirmation of our view as to the νοῦσος
θήλεια (feminine disease) we might further cite from
more modern times the examples given by <i>Reineggs</i>
and <i>J. von Potocki</i> in the case of the Mongolian race
of the Nogay, and by the older Historians of
America, particularly in connection with Florida and
Mexico. Notoriously down to the present day
Paederastia is in Asia one of the common vices,
while as to America some reporters when speaking
of the Men-women and Hermaphrodites of that
Continent, expressly state that they indulged in the
vice. But as the original Authorities are not accessible
to us, we can only refer to <i>Heyne</i>, loco citato,
p. 41. and <i>Stark</i>, loco citato, pp. 29 and 31., especially
as without this the subject has already occupied
overmuch space. Still we trust the less blame may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
attach to us on this account from the fact that so
distinguished a scholar as <i>Stark</i>, whose conclusions
even professed Philologists have endorsed, may
naturally claim of a younger enquirer in the same
field who challenges his views, not mere general
phrases, but the most complete and satisfactory
reasons possible. This much merit we trust he
cannot deny us!</p>

<p><i>Astruc</i>, II. p. 780., rightly censures the unsystematic

omission of Prefaces, Dedications and indeed all
matter except the actual texts. This edition received
subsequently a new Title-page, as is shown, according
to <i>Astruc</i>, II. p. 846., by the fact that not only does
the number of pages, lines and words closely agree
with the above mentioned edition, but also at the
end of the First Part the name of the printer Ziletti
occurs with the date 1556. The new Title reads

<p>The first issue of this Work published without the
name of the Author, must have been ready, as early
as the year 1750, for not only is the “Privilegium”
(licence to print) subscribed in that year (August
and October), but also Sanchez says himself in the
Preface to the second Part that this First Part had
appeared in Paris in 1750, published by Durand.
It runs thus: “M. <i>Castro</i>, Médecin de Londres, ayant
traduit en Anglais une dissertation avec ce titre:
Sur l’origine de la Maladie Vénérienne; imprimée à
Paris, chez Durand 1750, envoya un Exemplaire de
la traduction à M. le Baron de Van-Swieten”,—M.
<i>Castro</i>, Physician in London, having translated
into English a Dissertation entitled: <i>On the Origin of
the Venereal Disease</i>; printed at Paris 1750, and published
by Durand, sent a Copy of the Translation
to the Baron Van-Swieten). The Title of this
English Translation is: “<i>A Dissertation on the Origin
of Venereal Disease; proving that it was not brought
from America, but began in Europe by an Epidemical
Distemper. Translated from the original MS. by an
Eminent Physician</i>”. London 1751. 8vo. According
to this the Translation must have appeared very
nearly at the same time as the original.—A German
Translation came out under the Title: “<i>Treatise on
the Origin of the Venereal Disease</i>, in which is proved:
that this Evil did not come from America, but took
its beginning in Europe by an Epidemic,” translated
from the French; edited by <i>Georg Heinrich Weber</i>.

the Original may be found in: “<i>Commentaria de

divided into 7 Sections.—The <i>First Section</i> contains:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
Arguments proving that in most parts of Europe the
Venereal Disease became known and disseminated
since 1493, and last of all in the month of June
1495. pp. 1-10.—<i>Second Section</i>: When did Christopher
Columbus discover the Island of Hispaniola
and when did he return to Spain from his first and
second voyages? pp. 11-20.—<i>Third Section</i>: Did
the Venereal Disease come from America at the
time of Columbus’ return from his second voyage?
pp. 21-39.—<i>Fourth Section</i>: Did the Troops of
Fernandez Cordova communicate the Disease to the
French? pp. 40-47.—<i>Fifth Section</i>: Answer to some
objections that may be raised to prove that Venereal
Disease took its origin from America, pp. 47-79.—<i>Sixth
Section</i>: Reasons which caused Writers on
Venereal Disease since the year 1517 to believe this
Malady came from America, pp. 79-87.—<i>Seventh
Section</i>: Venereal Disease is an Epidemic Complaint,
which began in Italy and almost at the same time
spread over France and the rest of Europe, pp.
88-108.—<i>Recapitulation</i>: The Disease existed in
Italy and France before Columbus returned from
his second Voyage; the Troops of Cordova could
not have communicated it to the French, for the
two never came into contact; the Disease displayed
all the appearance of an Epidemic; the discovery of
the drug “Guajac” gave occasion to the assumption
of the American origin of the Disease.—<i>Van Swieten</i>,
who had received the English Translation sent to
him by Castro, only ought to weaken the proofs
brought forward in this book in his “Commentar. in
Boerhavi Aphorismos” (Commentary on Boerhaave’s
Aphorisms), Leyden 1772., Vol. V. pp. 373 sqq.,
which occasioned <i>Sanchez</i> to issue the following Work,
also published anonymously.</p>

together with the preceding (Leyden 1777. 8vo.)
and a Preface. An English Translation was edited

Martyr, pp. 1-24.—Div. 2. Symptoms of the so
called Venereal Disease, as they were observed
in Italy in the month of March 1793 and 1794. pp.
24-31.—Div. 3. In the history of Medicine there
is no Description of an epidemic Disease resembling
in all its consequences that which invaded Italy,
Spain and France in the years 1493 and 1494.
pp. 31-42.—Div. 4. The Venereal attacks, which
have been observed since the time of Hippocrates,
were not the consequence of the inflammatory or
chronic Venereal Disease, such as it has been observed
since the years 1493 and 1494. pp. 42-45.—Div. 5.
On certain passages in <i>Astruc’s</i> book “On the
Venereal Disease”. pp. 45-54.—Div. 6. Conclusions
from the passages of Pet. Pintor and Pet.
Delphinus concerning the Venereal Epidemic in
Italy, France and Spain in the years 1493, 1494.
pp. 54-61.—Div. 7. Did the early Voyages who
discovered the Harbours and Peoples of North and
South America observe the Venereal Disease, and
was their Manhood infected with it? pp. 62-72.—Div.
8. On the Spread of infectious Diseases by
sea, and the Quarantine observed during the Plague
on the different coasts of the Mediterranean Sea.
pp. 73-81.—<i>Recapitulation</i>: The Venereal Disease
prevailed as a “Febris Pestilentialis” (pestilential
fever) in March 1493, and after the arrival of Charles
VIII in Italy (1494) took the name of “Morbus
Gallicus” (French Complaint); the Venereal affections
observed in Antiquity are distinct from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
Venereal Disease as known since 1494; the Spaniards
imported it into the Antilles, and the French were
already infected when they came into Italy, where
the Disease had been prevalent before their arrival.
The early Voyages mention not a word of having
found the Disease among the Savages. America,
Africa and the East Indies have never communicated
their epidemic and endemic Diseases to Europe;
therefore the Venereal Disease cannot have been
brought by the Spaniards from America to Europe.—Both

<p>This “Program”, which <i>Hensler</i> wrote on his
resignation as Dean and for the Public Announcement
of certain Graduations, is divided into 10
Divisions, of which Div. 1 gives a survey of the
Contents, Div. 2 considers certain passages from the
genuine Writings of Hippocrates (Prorrhetic. 11, 18,
21, “de aere, aquis et locis”—“of the effects of air,
water and locality”, II. Aphorism. V. 22.) dealing
with <i>Herpes</i>, from which we gather that under the
name <i>Herpes</i> were understood eating (phagedenic)
Ulcers, that the <i>Herpes esthiomenes</i> attacked especially
the abdomen and the Genitals, that <i>Epinyctis</i> was
pre-eminently a disease of adults, whence a suspicion
arises of its being communicated by coition.
Div. 3 gives medical opinion on the different kinds
of <i>Herpes</i> down to <i>Celsus</i>. Div. 4 gives the same
on <i>Epinyctis</i>, special importance being given to the
pains at night. Div. 5 discusses the <i>Therioma</i> of
<i>Celsus</i> (V. 28. 3.), which according to <i>Pollux</i>, Onomast.
IV. 15., specially affects the Genitals, and is closely
akin to the <i>Epinyctis</i>. Div. 6 gives the views of
<i>Galen</i> on <i>Herpes</i>. Div. 7. The Author proceeds to
the <i>Formica</i> of the Arabians, and shows that they
have designated several distinct Skin-diseases by
this name. Div. 8 treats the views held by Arabic
writers down to the XVth. Century; whilst Div. 9
gives the shape these views took <i>during</i> the XVth.
Century. In Div. 10 <i>Hensler</i> draws the following
conclusions from the evidence he has adduced:
<i>Formica</i> was the same thing as the <i>Herpes</i> of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
Greeks; under both names, yet by no means
exclusively, were indicated syphilitic affections. Immorality
at all periods generated Venereal Disease,
which arose at first rather sporadically, but towards
the end of the XVth. Century in consequence of
its universal diffusion became virtually epidemic.
The early neglect of Etiology, as well as the Galenian
hypotheses of deteriorations of the humours, stood
in the way of the right understanding of the Disease.
Venereal Disease is not a single Malady, but a
Diathesis (General Condition of Body), which in
accordance with time and circumstances may manifest
itself in different forms. “Hujusmodi vero lues mihi
illa <em class="gesperrt">omnis</em> esse videtur, quae <em class="gesperrt">ipso coitu</em>, quo
quidem loco luis praecipuus focus est, facillime cum
aliis <em class="gesperrt">communicari</em> et ad ipsam prolem propagari
possit. <em class="gesperrt">Summa</em> ejus <em class="gesperrt">genera</em> esse equidem arbitror
<em class="gesperrt">Lepram</em>, malum, quod <em class="gesperrt">Pians</em> vocant, ipsamque
Syphilidem.” “This contagion seems to me to be a
general one, and of this sort that it is capable of
being very readily communicated to others by the
act of coition, where indeed is the chief <i>nidus</i> of the
Disease, and of being propagated even to posterity.
Its main forms are, in <i>my</i> opinion, Leprosy, a Malady
called <i>Pians</i>, and Syphilis itself.” (p. 54). The <i>Pians</i>
would seem to be Pox, the seeds of which the
Moors disseminated, Syphilis a “Morbus Europae

it are confuted. He cites here in the Notes, p. 238,
an Italian poem of George Summaripa, a Patrician
of Verona (1496), not previously known, in which
the Disease is represented as having come from
Gaul; which a letter of <i>Nicolaus Scillatius</i> re-printed

with Venereal Disease hinted at.—VIII. Of the
Origin of the Venereal Disease,—to Signor <i>Filip.

<p>The Author, a Jewish Physician, seeks to prove
that the Moors did not suffer from Venereal Disease,
because they as Martyrs of their Faith, could not therefore
be dissolute, immoral men, because (Deuteronomy,

Gentiles (Nehemiah Ch. X. vv. 29, 30) are strictly
forbidden, finally because <i>Don Isac Abarbanel</i>, born
1437, in his Exposition of the Prophets (printed 1650),
on Zachariah Ch. XIV. v. 12. says expressly, that
the Disease “Zarfosim” occurs only amongst the

treating of Substances imported from the East Indies
and used in Medicine, and of the Course to be
observed in taking the Mechoacan Root, etc. Written
and compiled by <i>Dr. Monardes</i>, Physician of Seville.
1565). This work treats of the drug “Guajac”, and
lays down the American origin of Venereal Disease
as confidently as if the Author had been on the
spot when it happened! The value of the whole
argument may be judged from this passage, “Our
Creator willed that from that same country whence
Venereal Disease (el mal de las buvas,—the malady
of buboes) came, should come also the Means of
its cure.”</p>

its appropriate Treatment has unfortunately never
yet appeared, though only then can we estimate the
justice of many of the Author’s views and statements
touching the local Symptoms. Would that an end
might be put to the delay!</p>

<p>In this somewhat cursory Treatise the Author
assumes with the English writers a “Lues antiqua”
(ancient Contagion), which manifested itself only
through affections of the Genitals of a similar nature,
and a “Lues universalis” (general Contagion) since
1494-1496, both of which now occur; hence he
would deduce the distinction in the treatment with
Mercury,—Mercury not being necessary for the
former, but required for the latter.</p>

it exhibited a greater degree of malignancy;
consequently that America is not to be considered

<p>To <i>Astruc</i> belongs the credit of having been the
first who began to collect on a comprehensive plan
and to sift the material for a history of the Venereal
Diseases that had been accumulating for Centuries.
His historical results are imperfect and one-sided,
in so far as they are directed solely to maintaining
the American origin; but at the same time his
chronological Review of the Writers from 1475 to
1740 is even now almost indispensable, as he gives
comprehensive Extracts from all the Works that were
at his disposal, that fill the whole of the second
Volume of his Book. Down to <i>Hensler</i>, almost all
later Historians owe to him their Bibliography of
Authorities, though they are not always honest enough
to specify the mine from which they drew their
knowledge. According to <i>Bertrandi</i>, “Treatise on
the Venereal Diseases”, transl. from the Italian by
<i>C. H. Spohr</i>, Vol. I. p. 44. Note k., <i>Astruc</i> has
copied almost the whole of the first book of this
Work, without naming the Author(!?), from: <i>Charles
Thuillier</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span> “Observations sur les maladies vénériennes
avec leur cure sûre et facile, lettres sur les accidents,
l’origine et les progrès de la vérole,” (Observations

edited with Addition and Notes by <i>Ludw. Christoph
Wilh. Cappel</i>, 1803. pp. XVI, 455. large 8vo.).</p>

<p>In the <i>First</i> Volume the Author gives, Bk. I.
Pt. 1. pp. 1-57, a history of the Venereal disease,
in which he employs every possible artifice and
perversion of the facts in his endeavour to prove
the American origin of the Disease. In the <i>Second</i>
and <i>Third</i> Vols. (in which the pages run on continuously,
pp. 808) he gives a general review of all
the Works that have appeared on Venereal disease
from 1595 to 1793, the total—including Supplements—amounting
to 1912. As far as <i>Astruc</i> served, he
has often translated him word for word,—without
declaring the fact. But as only those Works which
support his own views, in particular the American
origin, are estimated with any accuracy, while the
rest are summarily disposed of,—often without any
precise account of the Contents, it is properly
speaking solely for the sake of the Titles that the
Review as a whole is of use to Historians. A
Continuation of this Bibliographical review is found in:
<em class="gesperrt">Heinr. August Hacker</em>, Literatur der
syphilitischen Krankheiten vom Jahr 1794 bis mit
1829, etc. Leipzig 1830. 264 S. gr. 8. (<i>Heinr. August
Hacker</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span> “Literature of the Venereal Disease from
the year 1794 down to and including 1829, etc.”
Leipzig 1830. pp. 264. large 8vo.).</p>

<p>Unfortunately a major portion of the Books,
particularly of the foreign ones, did not actually
come into the hands of the Author, so that he was
forced often to content himself with merely citing
the Titles; and in such as are more precisely designated,
he omits, as indeed is the case also with
<i>Girtanner</i>, to give the length (pagination, or number
of sheets) of the Works, from which at any rate a
relative judgement might be made as to their completeness.
Then since its publication almost another
decade has passed, and the continuation of his
Collection is still awaited on the part of the Author;
consequently a second edition, carried on so as to
cover the latest period, one that has been very
prolific in Literary productions, is both necessary and
desirable, and in it what is deficient might easily
be supplied. Again from earlier Literature many
additions might well be made and supplements giving
what was overlooked or only cursorily noted by
<i>Girtanner</i>. However would it not on the whole
be more expedient to undertake an entirely new
Work dealing with the whole Literature of Venereal
Disease, but on other principles than those of <i>Girtanner</i>?
Indeed for such a task the use of a Library
such as Göttingen would be required. It would
undoubtedly be of very great utility.</p>

<p>The Author accepts the Development of Venereal

<p>In connection with other Diseases the Venereal
is also dealt with in the following Works:</p>

<p>The Author maintains the Antiquity of the Disease.

It would be a great mistake to think that because SPRENGEL wrote
his History here, the opposite must be true. The greater part of the
Works collected by him are no longer to be found. It is only too
evident that the earlier administrators of the library, especially
ERSCH, so famous as a Historian of Literature, left the medical side
almost totally unconsidered; and what gaps the Administration of
to-day has to fill up is sufficiently evidenced by the yearly Lists of
Additions.</p></div>

<i>Celsus</i>, De re medica Bk. VI. ch. 18., “Proxima sunt ea,
quae ad partes obscoenas pertinent, quarum apud Graecos vocabula
et tolerabilius se habent et accepta iam usu sunt, cum omni fere
medicorum volumine atque sermone iactentur, apud nos foediora verba, ne
consuetudine quidem aliqua verecundius loquentium commendata sunt.”
</p>
<p>
(Next are particulars relating to the unmentionable parts; the name
of these among the Greeks are less objectionable and are now accepted
by usage, as they are freely employed by physicians both in books and
speech, whereas with ourselves the words are coarse, not approved by
any customary use on the part of those who speak with any regard to
modesty.) How strictly the words, especially in the case of the poets,
were scrutinised in this respect even in later times still, is shown
by the passage in <i>Aulus Gellius</i>, Noct. Attic. Bk. X. ch. 10.; and in
<i>Petronius</i>, Satir. 132, Polyaenus says: Ne nominare quidem te (scil.
penem) inter res serias fas est. Poenitentiam agere sermonis mei coepi,
secretoque rubore perfundi, quod oblitus verecundiae meae cum ea parte
corporis verba contulerim, quam ne ad cogitationem quidem admittere
severioris notae homines solent.”
</p>
<p>
(It is forbidden even to mention thee (viz. the penis) in serious
discourse. I have begun to do penance for my words and to feel the glow
of a secret blush, because forgetful of my modesty I expressed in words
that part of the body, which men of the stricter type refuse to admit
even into their thoughts.) So the collector of Priapeia appeals to the
reader: Conveniens Latio pone supercilium! (Lay aside the disapproving
frown that befits Latium); and later on people used to say of such
talk, they wished to speak plain <i>Latin</i>, just as we say, speak <i>plain
English</i>; while the Greek would excuse himself by his ἄγροικος καὶ
ἄμουσός εἰμι, (I am but am unpolished rustic).</p></div>

Already in his time St. Jerome affirmed: omnem concubitum
coniugale esse peccatum, nisi causa procreandi sobolem (that all
conjugal coition is a sin, except for the sake of begetting offspring);
and <i>Andr. Beverland</i> (de peccato originali—On Original Sin, p. 60.);
Ingenitum nefas nil aliud est, quam coeundi ista libido, (Inborn sin is
nothing else than the foul craving for coition). With this should be
compared the view of <i>Lycurgus</i>, which <i>Plutarch</i> cites in his life of
him.

Aphrodité being rather chosen,—now this is sensual pleasure,—all was
thrown into confusion.) <i>Clement of Alexandria</i>, Paedog. bk. II. ch.
10. Ψιλὴ γὰρ ἡδονὴ, κἂν ἐν γάμῳ παραληφθῇ, παράνομός ἐστι καὶ ἄδικος

though it have been enjoyed in wedlock, is unlawful and unjust and
unreasonable.)—<i>Philo</i>, De opificio mundi, pp. 34, 35, 38. De Allegoria,

sensual pleasure.) With some coarseness Rabbi Zahira explains the
Fall. The Tree, he says, that bore the forbidden fruit signifies the
instrument of generation in Man; not the Tree in the midst of the
garden of Eden, he comments, but the Tree in the midst of the body,
which is not in the midmost of the garden, but in the midmost of the
Woman, for it is there that the garden is planted. <i>Nork</i>, “Braminen

Histor. Bk. I. ch. 199. Ἐπεὰν δὲ μιχθῇ, ἀποσιωσαμένη τῇ θεῷ,
ἀπαλλάσσεται ἐς τὰ οἰκία· καὶ τὠπὸ τούτου οὐκ οὕτω μέγα τί οἱ δώσεις
ὥς μιν λάμψεαι. (But after she has gone with a man, and so acquitted
her obligation to the goddess, she returns to her home; and from
that time forth no gift however great will prevail with her.) The
same thing is related also by <i>Baruch</i> VI. 42, 43. Comp. <i>Voss</i> on
<i>Virgil</i>, Georgics, II. 523 sqq. To this day we find amongst the bold
sons of the Desert, the Arabians, some trace of this devotion of their
fathers, Niebuhr writes (“Beschreibung von Arabien”—(Description of the
Arabians), Copenhagen 1772, p. 54. note.): “I read that the Europeans
have investigated with great erudition and eloquence the question, Num
inter naturalis debiti et conjugalis officii egerium liceat psallere,
orare, etc.? (Whether in the performance of the debt of nature and the
conjugal office it is lawful to sing, to pray, and so on?) I do not know what the Mohammedans have
written on this matter. I have been assured that it is their custom
to begin all their occupations with the words; Bismallâh errachmân
errachhîm (in the name of the merciful and gracious God), and that
they must say this also “ante conjugalis officii egerium (before the
performance of the conjugal office), and that no reputable man omits
this.” So at the present day in Italy the courtesan bows before the
image of her Madonna, before she gives herself, and says to her,
“Madonna, mi ajuta!” or “Madonna, mi perdonna!” (Madonna, be my aid!,
Madonna, pardon me!) whilst she draws a veil over her picture, and
calls this Christianity! For the rest Constantine abolished the custom
in question at Babylon and at Heliopolis, and destroyed the Temples of
Venus at those places. <i>Eusebius</i>, Life of Constantine, III. p. 58.

The beggars or Fakirs in India wander about the country in

17.) and excessively dirty (<i>Havus</i> “Historicae Relatio de Regno et
Statu magni Regis Magor,” (Historical Account of the Reign and State
of the great King Magor). Antwerp 1605. p. 1695); after their visits

quit their villages, so as to leave the monks a free hand. <i>Papi</i>,

<i>Strabo</i> and <i>Arrian</i>, Indic. 17., already in their time state,
at any rate of the nobler Indian women, that they could have been
allured to profligacy at no price, except at that of an elephant.
According to <i>von Bohlen</i> (“Das alte Indien,”—Ancient India, Vol. II.
p. 17, Vol. I. p. 275.) it would seem that not the slightest trace (?)
can be found of the immoral life of the Indian priests in Antiquity,
on the contrary that chastity was the first thing needful to gain
them respect and honour, and their whole literature is never ready
to extol a priest or hero more highly than when he has withstood the
enticements to unchastity. Hence what is asserted of the Devâdasis or
Priestesses of the gods as being courtesans for the Priests is also
in the main untrue, since it rests, as in the case of the Hieroduli,
chiefly on a confusion with the Bhayatri (Bayaderes, the Hetaerae
of the Greeks), or holds good only for particular places (<i>Häfner</i>,
“Landreise längs der Küste Orixa und Koromandel,”—(Journey along the
Orissa and Coromandel Coast). Weimar 1809. Vol. I. pp. 80 sqq.—<i>Papi</i>,
“Briefe über Indien,” (Letters about India), p. 356.—<i>Wallace</i>,
“Denkwürdigkeiten,” (Memorabilities), p. 301.)—In this connection
should be mentioned also the narrative of the Jesuit—in other respects
suspicious—in the edifying letters addressed to <i>Schaufus</i>, ch. I. p.
40, that during his residence in a Hindoo town he had been informed,
that it would be unsafe at the present moment to allow foreigners to
visit the Devadâsis, on the contrary that there was nothing to fear
from those attached to the Pagoda of the place. Even if we admit the
truth of this narrative for more modern times too, still the conclusion
that <i>Schaufus</i> draws from it, that in Hindostan every Pagoda is a
brothel, is surely somewhat hasty.—Some other legends of the origin of
the Lingam ritual in India are given in <i>Meiner’s</i> “Allgem. kritische

foam-sprung, Cyprus-born goddess, the patroness of Cinyras, Aphrodité
I mean, <i>she that loves the parts of a man, because from them she
sprung</i>, to wit those parts that were lopped off from Uranus, those
lewd parts which after their severance violated the sea-wave. Of such
foul components is Aphrodité the worthy child in the mysteries).</p></div>

καὶ τούτοις ἐγέραιρον τὸν θεόν, ὑπόμνημα ποιούμενοι πάθους. (Xanthias
mentions <i>the Phallus</i>.—Now about the Phallus itself the following
story is told. Pegasus removed the statues of Dionysus at Eleutherae
from there, and came to Athens with them. However the Athenians did
not receive the god with due honour. But for this ill counsel they by
no means got off scot-free; for the god was wroth, and a disease fell
upon the private parts of the men. The plague was incurable; and after
they had tried in vain every device of magic art and physician’s skill
against the disease that only grew the more, envoys were despatched
with all speed to the oracle. So these went up, and brought back the
reply that the only remedy was this, that they should bring in the
god in procession with all possible honour. Therefore the Athenians,
submitting themselves to what was reported as the will of heaven,
made phalli—private and public, and presented them to the god as a
complimentary gift, thus commemorating the affliction). A different
explanation from this is given by the <i>Scholiast</i> to <i>Lucian</i>, “De Syra
dea,” (Of the Syrian goddess), ch. 16., where the Phallus service is
brought in a measure into connection with Paederastia.</p></div>

Venerem putant, quod et ipsas perhibeant semina emittere et ob hoc
Libero eamdem virilis corporis partem in templo poni, femineam Liberae.
(The name of Liber (Bacchus) they derive from <i>liberamentum</i>, the act
of freeing, because males in the act of coition are freed by his aid
when the seed is emitted; the same function they consider Libera, who
is identified with Venus, to perform for women, because they say that
women also emit seed, and that for this reason that same part of the
male body is consecrated to Liber in his temple, and the corresponding
female part to Libera).</p></div>

strings, puppets). <i>Lucian</i>, De Syra Dea ch. 16. <i>Herodotus</i>, II.

(<i>dwarf</i>: applied to the undersized; dwarf, but having large private

In the Codex Coburgensis the Priapeia begin with the following
words: P. Virgilii Maronis Mantuani poetae clarissimi Priapi carmen
incipit feliciter, (the Song of Priapus by Publius Virgilius Maro, of
Mantua, the renowned poet, begins happily). Comp. <i>Bruckhusius</i> Notes
to Tibullus bk. IV. Eleg. 14. At any rate the majority of the poems
belong to the golden age of Roman literature. For readers of the old
poets it may perhaps not be out of place here to remark that <i>Priapus</i>
as <i>Cultor Hortorum</i> (Patron of Gardens) is not unfrequently mentioned
with an equivocal meaning, if indeed he has not come into the garden
entirely through misunderstanding. So we read in Priapeia, Ode 4.,
</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent2">Quod metis hortus habet, sumas impune licebit;</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Si dederis nobis, quod tuus hortus habet,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>
(What my garden has thou mayest take at will, if only thou give to us
what thine possesses) and in the “Anechomenos” of <i>Apuleius</i>.
</p>

<p>Thyrsumque pangant hortulo in Cupidinis,</p>

<p>
(Let them plant the thyrsus (Bacchic staff) in the garden-plat of
Cupid). Similarly <i>Lucretius</i>, Bk. IV. 1100., says, ut muliebria
conserat arva, (to sow the woman’s seed-fields), and <i>Virgil</i>, Georgics
III. 136., speaks of, genitali arvo, (the seed-field of generation).
Possibly in this direction may be found a better interpretation of
the, irriguo nihil est elutius horto, (There is nought more insipid
than a new-watered garden), of <i>Horace</i>, Satires Bk. II. 4. 16. The
Greeks used in the same way their word κῆπος (garden), e. g. <i>Diogenes
Laertius</i>, II. 12, and <i>Hesychius</i> explains it by τὸ ἐφήβιον γυναικεῖον
(the female organ of puberty). Similarly in <i>Aristophanes</i> καλὸν
ἔχουσα τὸ πεδίον, (having the plain beautiful). The Koran also says,
Thy Wife is thy field!</p></div>

<i>Jonathan</i>, on Numbers Ch. 25. v. I. Might one draw attention to
the old Greek πέος (the penis), which is found in <i>Aristophanes</i> and
<i>Antipater</i>,—p. 72. Note 2. loco citato? The adjective πεοίδης (πεώδης)
is given in <i>Eustathius</i> according to <i>Schneider</i>, in the sense: with
thick, swollen member; and <i>Rodigin</i>, Lect. Antiq. Bk. VIII. ch. 6. p.
377, says: Postremo qui ex intemperanti Veneris usu pereunt, dicuntur
<i>Peolae</i>, media producta, quia Peos signet pudendum, sive veretrum,
(Lastly those who are undone by excessive indulgence in Love are called
<i>Peolae</i>, with the middle vowel long, because <i>Peos</i> means the private,
or privy, member. Possibly the old form was πέορ, just as sometimes
πόϊρ stands for πάϊς in the Laconian dialect. Moreover <i>Penis</i> might
surely more readily be derived from πέος than from what is commonly
given as its derivation, <i>pendendo</i> (because it hangs), in as much as
the parts of the body are named from the condition of their activity,
not of their rest. Thus Baal-<i>Peor</i> would be “Lord of the Penis”! ἄναξ

Yet this would appear to have been no serious loss, for the
disease was quite able indeed to weaken the power of the Jews, but
not to actually destroy it. So Balaam says in <i>Josephus</i> (loco
cit. § 6.): Hebraeorum quidem genus nunquam funditus peribit, nec
bello, nec <i>peste</i>, nec inopia terrae fructuum, nec alio casu
inopinato delebitur.—In mala autem nonnulla et calamitates ad breve
tempus incident; a quibus licet deprimi humique affligi videantur,
postea tamen reflorescent, cum eos timere coeperint qui damna illis
intulerant. (The nation of the Hebrews in fact will never utterly
perish, and can be destroyed neither by war, nor <i>plague</i>, nor famine
of the fruits of the earth, nor any other unlooked for disaster.—They
will fall however for a brief space into sundry ills and calamities;
whereby they may well seem to be broken down and brought to the earth.
But they will flourish again, when once they have learned to fear the
enemies that brought the disasters upon them). It was in order to bring
about this consummation that Balaam gave his advice just cited.</p></div>

true this purely moral view, as it was originally, of marriage, came in

that it appears an exceedingly homely bit of prose, and one is led away

(So too Philemon in his play the “Adelphi” relates that it was Solon
who first on account of the vigorous desires of the young men bought
and established public women in brothels. The same is related by
Nicander of Colophon in the Third book of his Colophoniaca, who says
that he (Solon) was the first to found a temple of the Pandemian
Aphrodité, built from the gains of the women in charge of brothels.
<i>Philemon</i> writes as follows “Well hast thou deserved of all men,
Solon; for thou they say wert first to invent a thing both popular, by
Zeus, and salutary. Seeing the city crowded full of young men, <i>and
these possessed of the natural appetites of manhood, and consequently
offending in quarters unmeet, bought women and established them
in certain places to be common to all and put there for that very
purpose</i>. There they are, standing all but naked; don’t be cheated;
examine everything.... The door is open. One obol; in you go. There’s
not an atom of coyness, no coquetry, no stealing off; but right away as
you please and how you please. You have left the house? tell the girl
go hang! she’s nothing to you.”)

In the better times of Athens this never occurred. The women
were kept far too closely shut up; and their moral behaviour was
subject to the supervision of the γυναικονόμοι (Commissioners for the

that Timarchus as having exercised the trade of prostitution is not
competent to address the people, he does not deny the fact charged
against his client by the accuser, but says, ‘I demand the evidence of
any <i>tax-collector who collected this tax</i> from Timarchus.’ ... but he
will cross-examine as to the localities where he was established in the
business, and will question the collectors as to whether they have ever
levied prostitution-tax upon him).

This passage shows at the same time in the clearest way that
<i>Schneider</i> is wrong, when in his Lexicon he explains πορνοτελώνης,
occurring in <i>Pollux</i>. Onomast. VII. 202., IX. 29., as meaning a
privileged or licenced whore-master, paying a duty to the magistrates
on his trade. Besides, anything like a sanitary police supervision
on the part of the Agoranomi at this period is of course out of the
question. For the word ἀσφαλῶς (safely) in the fragment of <i>Eubulus</i>,
(Athenaeus bk. XIII. p. 568), where it is said of the brothel-girls:

<p>
(from whom surely and <i>safely</i> you may buy your pleasure for a small
coin), admits of an easy explanation, if we consider that these common
women are contrasted here not with the hetaerae but with the free women
of the city, illicit intercourse with whom was always dangerous for
the voluptuary, being punished as rape or adultery. The most telling
proof is afforded by the passage of <i>Diogenes Laertius</i>, bk. VI. ch.
4., where he says: “When <i>Antisthenes</i> saw a man accused of adultery,
he said to him, Unhappy man, what serious risk you might have avoided
for an obol! (ὦ δυστυχὴς, πηλίκον κίνδυνον ὀβολοῦ διαφυγεῖν εδύνασο).
Also the passage of <i>Xenarchus</i>, (Athenaeus, bk. XIII. p. 569.), is
pertinent, where it is said, καὶ τῶν δ’ ἑκάστην ἐστὶν ἀδεῶς, εὐτελῶς,
(and of the women each can be enjoyed without fear, cheaply). Hence too

This can best be seen from the Speech of <i>Demosthenes</i>, In

follows in the Latin translation: Iam peregrinam esse Neaeram, id
vobis ab ipso primordio demonstrabo. Septem puellas ab ipsa infantia
emit Nicareta, Charisii Elei liberta, Hippiae coqui eius uxor, gnara
et perita perspiciendae venustae parvulorum naturae et eos sollerter
educandi instituendique scia, ut quae artem eam exerceret, atque ex ea
re victum collegisset, filiarum autem eas nomine compellavit, ut quam
maximas ab iis, qui earum consuetudinem, tanquam ingenuarum appetebant,
mercedes exigeret, posteaquam autem florem aetatis earum magno cum
quaestu prostituit: uno, ut dicam, fasce, corpora etiam earum, cum
septem essent, vendidit: Antiae, Stratolae, Aristoclae, Metanirae,
Philae, Isthmiadis et Neaerae. Quam igitur unusquisque earum emerit,
et ut ab iis qui eos a Nicareta emerant, libertate donatae sint. (That
Neaera was a foreigner by birth, I will make it my first business to
prove. Seven girls were bought in earliest childhood by Nicareta,
freed-woman of Charisius of Elis, wife of his cook Nicias,—a knowing
woman, astute at noting the promise of beauty in children and skilful
in their clever upbringing and instruction, as might be expected of
one who practised that art as a profession and had made her living
thereby. Her daughters however she called them, that she might demand
the greater fees from such as sought to enjoy their favours, as being
free-born maidens. Then when they had reached the flower of their
age, she prostituted them with great profit to herself, selling their
persons, seven as they were, in one bundle, so to express it,—whose
names were Antia, Stratole, Aristoclea, Metanira, Phile, Isthmias, and
Neaera. Thus each of them found a purchaser, and on such conditions
that they were presented with their freedom by the lovers who had
bought them from Nicareta).</p></div>

The law was in the first instance made only with a view to the
future, in order to ensure the state a sufficiently large number of
citizens; <i>Sozomenes</i>, Histor. Eccles., I. 9., Vetus lex fuit apud
Romanos, quae vetabat coelibes ab anno aetatis quinto et vigesimo
pari iure essent cum maritis.—Tulerant hanc legem veteres Romani, cum
sperarent, futurum hac ratione, ut urbs Roma et reliquae provinciae
imperii Romani hominum multitudine abundarent. (There was an old law
among the Romans, which forbad bachelors after the age of 25 to enjoy
equal political rights with married men.—The old Romans had passed this
law in the hopes that in this way the city of Rome, and the provinces
of the Roman empire as well, might be ensured an abundant population).
For the same reason <i>Caesar</i>, after the African War when the city was
much depopulated through the great number of the slain, established
prizes for such citizens as had the most children).—<i>Dio Cassius</i>,
Bk. XLIII. 226.—All this availed little. The Censors <i>Camillus</i> and
<i>Posthumius</i> were soon obliged to introduce a tax on celibacy,—the
“old-bachelors’ tax” (Aes uxorium).—<i>Festus</i>, p. 161., <i>L. Valerius

Instit Divin., I. 20. 6., Flora cum magnas opes ex arte
meretricia quaesivisset, populum scripsit haeredem, certamque pecuniam
reliquit, cuius ex annuo foenere suus natalis dies celebraretur
editione Ludorum, quos appelant Floralia. (Flora having acquired great
riches by the harlot’s calling made the people her heir, and left
a certain sum of money, the interest of which was to be applied to
celebrating her birth-day by the exhibition of the games which are
called Floralia.—I. 20. 10., Celebrantur cum omni lascivia. Nam praeter
verborum licentiam, quibus obscoenitas omnis effunditur, exuuntur etiam
vestibus populo flagitante meretrices, quae tunc mimarum funguntur
officio et in conspectu populi, usque ad satietatem impudicorum hominum
cum pudendis motibus detinentur. (They are solemnized with every form
of licentiousness. For over and above the looseness of speech that
pours forth every obscenity, harlots strip themselves of their clothing
at the importunities of the mob, and then act as mimes,—pantomimic
actors,—and in full view of the crowd indulge in indecent posturings,
till their shameless audience is satisfied). It may be noted that
scarcely 40 years after the introduction of the Floralia, P. Scipio
Africanus in his Speech in defence of Tib. Asellus could say: Si
nequitiam defendere vis, licet: sed tu in uno scorto maiorem pecuniam
absumsisti, quam quanti omne instrumentum fundi Sabini in censum
dedicavisti. Ni hoc ita est: qui spondet mille nummum? Sed tu plus
tertia parte pecuniae perdidisti atque absumsisti in flagitiis. (If you
choose to defend your profligacy, well and good! but as a matter of
fact you have wasted on one strumpet more money than the total value,
as you declared it to the Census commissioners, of all the plenishing
of your Sabine farm. If you deny my assertion, I ask who dare wager
a thousand sesterces on its untruth? You have squandered more than
a third of the property you inherited from your father, and thrown
it away in debauchery).—Gellius, Noct. Attic., VII. 11.—As not only
did hetaerae build a temple to Aphrodité, but a similar one was also
erected in their honour at Abydos (<i>Athenaeus</i>, XIII. p. 573.), and
Phryné wished to rebuild Thebes at her own cost, on the condition that
an inscription should be set up to the effect, “Alexander destroyed it;
Phryné the hetaera restored it”, there is not the slightest reason for
counting the above story as merely one of the ridiculous inventions
common in the Fathers.</p></div>

Read the Speech of Cato in <i>Livy</i>, Hist., bk. XXXIV. 4., where
the following passage is found amongst others: Haec ego, quo melior
lactiorque in dies fortuna rei publicae est, imperiumque crescit, et
iam in Graeciam Asiamque transcendimus, omnibus libidinum illecebris
repletas, et regias etiam attrectamus gazas, eo plus horreo, ne illae
magis res nos ceperint, quam nos illas. (All these changes, as day by
day the fortune of the State is higher and more prosperous and her
Empire grows greater, and our conquests extend over Greece and Asia,
lands replete with every allurement of the senses, and we appropriate
treasures that may well be called royal,—all this I dread the more from
my fear that such high fortune may rather master us than we master it).
Scarcely 10 years later the same author says (bk. XXXIX. 6.): Luxuriae
enim peregrinae origo ab exercitu Asiatico invecta in urbem est. (For
the beginnings of foreign luxury were brought into the city by the
Asiatic army). <i>Juvenal</i>, Sat. VI. 299.:

</div></div></div>

<p>
(Foul money it was that first brought in foreign manners; wealth
weakened and broke down the vigour of the age with base luxury). But
pre-eminently applicable are the following words (III. 60 sqq.) of the
same poet:

(I cannot bear, Quirites, to see Rome a Greek city,—and yet how mere

The usual derivation of the word <i>lupanar</i> (brothel) is from
Lupa, the wife of Faustulus (<i>Livy</i>, I. 4.); thus <i>Lactantius</i>, Divin.
Instit., bk. I. 20 sqq., says, fuit enim Faustuli uxor et, propter
vulgati corporis vilitatem, Lupa inter pastores, id est meretrix,
nuncupata est, unde etiam lupanar dicitur. (For she was the wife of
Faustulus, and because of the easy rate at which her person was held at
the disposal of all, was called among the shepherds Lupa, (she-wolf),
that is harlot, whence also Lupanar—a brothel—is so called). Comp.
<i>Isidore</i>, bk. XVIII. etymol. 42. <i>Jerome</i>, in Eusebius’ Chronicle.
However it is a fruitless effort to try and connect lupar and lupanar
with lupus, the wolf. If we are not mistaken, the root-word is the
Greek λῦμα, filth, and so, shameless person; from this comes <i>lupa</i>,
just as from λῦμαρ was formed <i>lupar</i>, the oldest form for lupanar,
which has maintained itself in the adjective <i>luparius</i>, and in
<i>lupariae</i> in <i>Rufus</i> and <i>A. Victor</i> as synonyms of lupanar. Indeed
<i>Lactantius</i> speaks of the hetaerae Leaena and Cedrenus as γυναῖκας
λυκαίνας.</p></div>

The common derivation of <i>fornix</i> (brothel) is from <i>furnus</i> or
fornax (an oven), or else makes it identical with fornix, an archway.
<i>Isidore</i>, bk. X. 110., writes: a <i>fornicatrix</i> is one whose person is
public and common. These women used to lie under archways, and such
places are called <i>fornices</i>, whence also <i>fornicariae</i> (whores).
Granted that the women used to resort in numbers to the arches in the
town-walls through which sorties were made (<i>Livy</i>, XXXVI. 23., XLIV.
11.), yet several passages in ancient authors prove clearly that the
<i>fornices</i> were <i>houses</i> (especially <i>Petronius</i>, Satir. 7., <i>Martial</i>
XI. 62.). The <i>ancient Glosses</i> have:—“fornicaria”: πορνὴ ἀπὸ καμάρας ᾗ
ἵστανται, (a harlot, from the chamber where they take their stand). But
in all probability the brothels took their name from the circumstance
of their being situated in the neighbourhood of the town-wall and its
arches; for which reason the women were also called <i>Summoenianae</i>
(women of the Summoenium,—district under the walls). Martial, XI. 62.,
III. 82., I. 35., XII. 32. Or should we say that <i>fornix</i> was formed
from πορνικὸν?</p></div>

mention that in this case <i>tibi</i> would have to be read for <i>tuum</i>,
it is a perfectly well known fact that <i>frons</i> (front, forehead) was
used in Latin for the face of a door (<i>Ovid</i>, Fasti, I. 135., Omnis
habet geminas, hinc atque hinc, ianua frontes, (Every door has two
faces, inside and out). <i>Seneca</i> says <i>pependit</i> (it hung there), and

This is seen most clearly from the following passage in the “Vita
Apollonii Tyrii”, (Life of Apollonius of Tyre), p. 695., Puella ait,
prosternens se ad pedes eius: miserere, domine, virginitatis meae,
ne prostituas hoc corpus sub tam turpi titulo. Leno vocavit villicum
puellarum et ait, ancilla, quae praesens est et exornetur diligenter et
scribatur et titulus, quicunque Tarsiam deviolaverit, mediam liberam
dabit: postea ad singulos solidos populo patebit. (Says the girl,
throwing herself at his feet: “Sir! have pity on my maidenhood, and do
not prostitute this fair body under so ugly a name.” The Brothel-keeper
(Leno) called the Superintendent (villicus) of the girls and says,
“Let the maid here present be decked out with every care, and a
name-ticket written for her; the man that takes Tarsia’s virginity
shall pay half a “libera” (?), afterwards she shall be at the disposal
of all comers at a “solidus” or “aureus”, gold coin worth 25 denarii,
say 20 shillings—each). So we see even in the name there prevailed a
certain luxury; and a young girl of handsome person would fain have a
handsome-sounding name to match.</p></div>

</p>
<p>
It is well-known what trouble <i>Bentley</i> gave himself to explain this
<i>locus implicatissimus</i> (most intricate passage), as he calls it,
because he supposed the common reading to be corrupt and accordingly
altered the text, all to bring out a comparison of Cerinthus’ thigh—a
comparison that never was in Horace’s mind at all. Several years ago in
our Work, “De Sexuali Organismorum Fabrica,” (On the Sexual Fabric of
Organisms), Spec. I., Halle 1832. large 8vo., p. 61., we disentangled
the matter and showed exactly how it stood, proving that the “Sit licet
hoc, Cerinthe, tuum” (Though this be your (opinion), Cerinthus) must
be taken as a parenthesis, consequently that the usual reading is the
right one. But as the book would seem to have come into few hands, and
least of all into those of Philologists, we may be allowed to take this
opportunity of once more developing our view. The comparison is between
the matron and the “togata”, and it is maintained that the matron,
i. e. the noble Roman lady, possesses for all her jewelry neither a
softer thigh nor a straighter leg than the “togata”, the girl of common
stamp; that the latter in fact can often make a better show of both,
even though her leg is as crooked as the matron’s is,—a peculiarity
that <i>every</i> female leg has, because in a woman the knee projects more
forwards. <i>Aristotle</i>, Hist. Anim., IV. 11. 6., even in his time notes
this fact: τὸ θῆλυ τῶν ἀῤῥένων καὶ γονυκροτώτερον. (the female is more
knock-kneed also than the male). Comp. same author’s Physiognom., 3. 5.
6. <i>Adamant.</i>, Physiognom., II. 107. ed. Sylb. <i>Polemo</i>, Physiognom.,
p. 179. Anatomical investigation moreover proves this most clearly.
But as Cerinthus seems to be ignorant of it, in spite of its being a
well known Act, he lets himself be deluded by the outward magnificence
of attire and distinguished birth, and believes the matron to be the
better built, and it is for this mistake the poet taunts him. Horace in
this passage is merely giving a commentary on v. 63 above. Now compare
what <i>Plautus</i>, Mostell., I. 3. 13, makes Scopha say to Philemation,
Non vestem amatores mulieris amant, sed vestis fartum (’Tis not the
dress of a woman that lovers love, but the <i>lining</i> of the dress);
also <i>Martial</i>, III. Epigr. 33.; and the folly of <i>Cerinthus</i> is made
quite obvious. The phrase—Sit licet hoc tuum (Though this be yours)
in the sense, “though you look at it this way, take the dazzle of
jewels as the criterion of a woman’s beauty”, surely needs no further
confirmation.</p></div>

payment. <i>Juvenal</i>, Sat. VI. 125. Excepit blanda intrantes atque aera
poposcit. (Blandly she welcomed her visitors as they entered and asked

Already in <i>Livy</i>, II. 18., we read the account: Eo anno Romae,
cum per ludos ab Sabinorum iuventute per lasciviam scorta raperentur,
etc. (That year at Rome, when during the games harlots were carried
off in their wantonness by the youth of the Sabines, etc.) <i>Plautus</i>,
Casin. Prolog., 82-86.; this passage is repeatedly cited in this
connection, but really has only a remote bearing on the matter. But
in confirmation <i>Isidore</i>, XVIII. 42., says: Idem vero theatrum
idem et prostibulum, eo quod <i>post ludos exactos meretrices ibi
prosternerentur</i>. (But theatre and brothel were identical, for <i>after
the games were over, harlots used to prostitute themselves there</i>).
Comp. <i>Buleng.</i> De Theatro I. 16. and 49. <i>Lipsius</i>, Elect., I. 11.
Of course these statements may refer equally well to the Floralia or,
as <i>Isidore</i> lived so much later, to the lascivious representations
of brothel-life of which <i>Tertullian</i> tells us. The latter writes,
De Spectaculis ch. 17., Ipsa etiam prostibula, publicae libidinis
hostiae, in scena proferantur, plus miserae in praesentia feminarum,
quibus solis latebant: perque omnis aetatis, omnis dignitatis ora
transducuntur, locus, stipes, elogium, etiam quibus opus est,
praedicatur. (Nay, the very harlots, victims of the public lust, are
brought forward on the stage, more wretched still in the presence of
women, who alone used to be ignorant of such things; and they are
discussed by the lips of every age and every condition, and place,
origin, merits, even what should never be mentioned, are freely spoken
of). In 1791 in a public theatre in Paris just such things were
represented as <i>Juvenal</i> in his Sixth Satire speaks of as being acted
at Rome. Gynaeology Pt. III. p. 423. That whores were to be found in
the Theatre as well as in the Circus is shown by <i>Lampridius</i>, Vita
Heliogab., ch. 32., fertur et una die ad omnes <i>circi</i> et <i>theatri</i> et
<i>amphitheatri</i> et omnium urbis locorum <i>meretrices</i> ingressus. (And
access is given on one day to all the <i>harlots of circus, theatre
and amphitheatre</i> and all the places of the city). Comp. ch. 26.,
and <i>Abram.</i> on Cicero’s Speech for Milo ch. 24. p. 177. Perhaps at
all these spots “chambers” (cellae) were put up, to which the word
<i>locorum</i> (places) above may very well refer.</p></div>

in Egypt bore a child, which was preserved at that place. The text
reads, Δωρόθεος δέ φησιν ὁ ἰατρὸς ἐν Ὑπομνήμασιν, ἐν Ἀλεξανδρείᾳ,
τῇ κατ’ Αἴγυπτον, κίναιδον τεκεῖν· τὸ δὲ βρέφος ταριχευθὲν, χάριν
τοῦ παραδόξου, φυλάττεσθαι. (Now Dorotheus the Physician says in his
Memoirs, that at Alexandria in Egypt a <i>cinaedus</i> brought forth; and
that the babe was mummified and kept as a curiosity). The same thing
is reported in the following chapter of a slave with the Roman army in
Germany under the command of T. Curtilius Mancias. These stories may
possibly borrow some probability from modern investigations as to the
“foetus” within the “foetus”. The expression “to sow seed on barren
rocks” occurs, it may be mentioned, very frequently in connection with
paederastia in the Fathers.</p></div>

greatest when the organs are delivered full-grown to the surgeons,
just in the heat of youth, just when the down of puberty is darkening.

Crete as in all Dorian States Paedophilia was a universal and official
institution, yet paederastia too was common enough, as is shown by
the censure expressed by <i>Plato</i> (De Legibus bk. I. 636., bk. VII.
836.) and <i>Plutarch</i>, (De puerorum educatione ch. 14.).—as also by the
expression Κρῆτα τρόπον (Cretan fashion) given in <i>Hesychius</i>; and
probably the word κρητίζειν (to play the Cretan) is to be understood
from this point of view also. <i>Pfeffinger</i>, “De Cretum vitiis,” (Of the
Vices of the Cretans). Strasbourg 1701. 4to. From this <i>Aristotle</i>
(Politics II. 7. 5.) may have got the idea that the lawgiver in Crete
introduced paederastia in order to check the increase of population.

fashion, i.e. to indulge in boy-loves). Of the Scythians later on.</p></div>

Thus <i>Plutarch</i>, Eroticus, ch. 5., Ἡ δὲ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀῤῥένων ἀκόντων,

will by dint of force or robbery, or if voluntarily, then only because
in their wantonness and effeminacy they consent to men <i>treading
them</i>, as Plato puts it, <i>like a four-footed beast</i>, and emitting seed
with them unnaturally—this pleasure is a <i>graceless</i> one altogether,
and unseemly and <i>loveless</i>). The passage of Plato referred to here
is in the Phaedrus, p. 250 E., ὥστε οὐ σέβεται προσορῶν, ἀλλ’ ἡδονῇ
παραδοὺς <em class="gesperrt">τετράποδος νόμον βαίνειν</em> ἐπιχειρεῖ καὶ παιδοσπορεῖν, καὶ

(And so he feels no reverence when he looks on him, but giving way to
pleasure endeavours to <i>tread like a four-footed beast</i> and to emit his
seed, and using insolent violence in his intercourse, has no fear and
no shame in pursuing pleasure in an unnatural way). As something παρὰ

<p>
(Son of Patricius, a very discreet man, who by <i>unholy love seduces</i>
all his comrades). But above all the passage in <i>Aeschines</i>,
Orat. in Timarch. edit. Reiske, p. 146., is to the point in this
connection: ὁρίζομαι δ’ εἶναι, τὸ μὲν ἐρᾶν τῶν καλῶν καὶ σωφρόνων,
φιλανθρώπου, πάθος καὶ εὐγνώμονος ψυχῆς· τὸ δὲ ἀσελγαίνειν ἀργυρίου
τινὰ μισθούμενον, ὑβριστοῦ καὶ ἀπαιδεύτου ἀνδρὸς ἔργον εἶναι ἡγοῦμαι·
καὶ τὸ μὲν ἀδιαφθόρως ἐρᾶσθαι, φημὶ καλὸν εἶναι· τὸ δὲ ἐπαρθέντα
μισθῷ πεπορνεῦσθαι, αἰσχρόν. (Now I make this distinction, that to
love honourable and prudent friends is the passion of an amiable and
reasonable soul; whereas to behave licentiously, hiring anyone for
the purpose, I consider the act of a ruffianly and uncultivated man.
Similarly, to be loved purely, I declare to be a noble thing; but,
induced by pay, to allow oneself to be debauched, a foul thing). Anyone
who has read this passage attentively, together with what follows
in the Speech, cannot possibly any longer confound Paedophilia with
Paederastia, or maintain that the latter was approved by the Greeks.</p></div>

If <i>capra</i> (she-goat) here has the meaning of <i>scortum</i> (common
strumpet),—and it cannot very well signify anything else,—the passage
is an undoubted proof that such swellings were a consequence of
coition with <i>common</i> prostitutes, and that the latter were ordinarily
affected with them.—In <i>Petronius</i>, Sat. ch. 46., it is said of some
one: Ingeniosus est et bono filo etiamsi in nave morbosus est. (He is
of good abilities and good fibre, but he is diseased with swellings on
the fundament.) <i>Burmann</i> notes on this: In nave—id est mariscas habet.
Navis est podex ficosus. Hinc dictum illud Casellii apud Quintilianum,
(De Instit. Orat. VI. 3. 87.) Consultori dicenti, <i>navem dividere
volo</i>, respondentis, <i>perdes</i>. (<i>In nave</i>—that is, he has swellings.
Navis (literally a ship) means a fundament afflicted with swellings.
Hence the <i>bon mot</i> of Casellius, quoted in <i>Quintilian</i>. In reply
to a client who said “I wish to cut (divide into shares) my ship”
(navis,—means also diseased fundament), he retorted, “It’ll be fatal!”)</p></div>

derision.). <i>Martial</i>, I. 93., Saepe mihi queritur Celsus.... Tangi

by neglecting the honours due to Aphrodité, stirred the goddess’ anger
against them. For <i>she inflicted on them all an ill-odour, so that
they were no longer pleasing to their husbands</i>). To the same purport
the Scholiast on <i>Euripides</i>, Hecuba v. 887., who cites Didymus as
authority:
</p>
<p>
Ἐν Λήμνῳ γυναῖκες ἐτέλουν ἐτήσιον ἑορτὴν Ἀφροδίτῃ· ἐπεὶ οὖν ποτε
καταφρονήσασαι τῆς θεοῦ, ἀπέλιπον τὸ ἔθος, <em class= "gesperrt">ἡ Ἀφροδίτη ἐνέβαλεν αὐταῖς
δυσωδίαν, ὡς μὴ δύνασθαι τοὺς ἑαυτῶν ἄνδρας αὐταῖς πλησιάσαι</em>· αἱ δὲ
νομίσασαι, ὑπὸ τῶν ἀνδρῶν καταφρονεῖσθαι, τούτους πάντας ἀπέκτειναν.
ὁ δέ Δίδυμος οὕτω. (At Lemnos the women used to celebrate a yearly
festival in honour of Aphrodité. And so when on one occasion they
scorned the goddess and neglected the custom, Aphrodité afflicted them
with an ill odour, so that their own husbands could not come near
them. And they concluding they were scorned by their husbands, killed
them all. Didymus confirms this). The Lesbian <i>Myrtilus</i> or <i>Myrsilus</i>
gives a different account of the origin of the evil smell of the
Lesbian women, representing it in the First Book of his “Lesbica” as
a consequence of the magic arts of Medea, who had landed with Jason
at Lemnos. The story was taken from the lost Work of Myrtilus by
<i>Antigonus Carystius</i>, Histor. mirab. collect., edit. J. Meursius.
Leyden 1629. 4to., ch. 130. p. 97., Τὰς δέ Λημνίας δυσόσμους γενέσθαι,
Μηδείας ἀφικομένης μετ’ Ἰάσονος καὶ φάρμακα ἐμβαλλούσης εἰς τὴν
νῆσον· κατὰ δέ τινα χρόνον καὶ μάλιστα ἐν ταύταις ταῖς ἡμέραις, ἐν
αἷς ἱστοροῦσι τὴν Μήδειαν παραγενέσθαι, δυσώδεις αὐτὰς οὕτως γίνεσθαι
ὥστε μηδένα προσϊέναι. (And that the Lemnian women became malodorous,
when Medea came thither with Jason and cast poisonous drugs on the
island; and that for some length of time and particularly in those days
when Medea is related to have been there, they were so ill-smelling
that no man could approach them.) Also the Scholiast on <i>Apollonius
Rhodius</i>, I. 165., says: τῶν ἄλλων ἱστορούντων, ὅτι κατὰ χόλον τῆς
Ἀφροδίτης αἱ Λημνιάδες δύσοσμοι ἐγένοντο, Μυρτίλος ἐν πρώτῳ Λεσβικῶν
διαφέρεται· καὶ φησὶ τὴν Μήδειαν παραπλέουσαν, διὰ ζηλοτυπίαν ῥίψαι
εἰς τὴν Λήμνον φάρμακον, καὶ δυσοσμίαν γενέσθαι ταῖς γυναιξίν, εἶναί
τε μέχρι τοῦ νῦν κατ’ ἐνιαυτὸν ἡμέραν τινὰ, ἐν ᾗ διὰ τὴν δυσωδίαν
ἀποστρέφονται τὰς γυναῖκας ἄνδρές τε καὶ υἱεῖς. (Whereas others relate
that in consequence of the anger of Aphrodité the women of Lemnos
became evil-smelling, Myrtilus in the first Book of the “Lesbica”
tells a different tale. He says that Medea, sailing past the land,
moved by envy cast a poison on the island, and so an ill odour fell on
the women; further that there is down to the present time a day once
a year, on which owing to this foul odour husbands and sons turn and
flee from the women.) Finally there is an Epigram of <i>Lucillius</i> in the
<i>Greek Anthology</i> (edit. H. de Bosch, Vol. I. p. 416.) Bk. II. Tit. 14.
no. 4., mentioning the evil smell of the Lemnian women:

(Neither the Chimaera of Homer had so ill a smell, nor yet the herd
(as the story goes) of fire-breathing bulls, not <i>all Lemnos</i>, not
the foulest of the Harpies, nor even Philoctetes’ putrefying foot.
So you see, Telesilla, you outdo—the vote is unanimous,—Chimaeras,
putrefactions, bulls, birds, <i>Lemnian women</i>!) The stench of Telesilla
outdid, we see, all known evil smells, even that of the Lemnian women,
etc. Also in <i>Valerius Flaccus</i>, bk. II. 99-241., is found this myth
of the Lemnian women.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_311_311" href="#FNanchor_311_311" class="label">311</a>
Hence Iphis, in <i>Ovid</i>, Metam., IX. 723 sqq., says:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<p>
(Iphis loves one that she knows, alas! she can never enjoy, and this
fact itself increases her passion. A maiden burns for a maiden. Hardly
keeping back her tears she cries: What fate awaits me,—me who suffer
sorrow of Venus known to none, a sorrow monstrous and of strange new
sort? If the gods were willing to spare me, they would have given me a
<i>natural</i> curse surely, one <i>of ordinary kind</i>. No cow burns for a cow,
no mare for the love of mares, nor any woman is taken with love for a
woman. Would I were no woman!)
</p>
<p>
Similarly <i>Lucillius</i> says of the paederast Cratippus in the Greek

<p>
(Of the boy-loving Cratippus will I tell you; for a strange new wonder
I report. <i>Yea! great are the penalties he pays.</i> The boy-loving
Cratippus we have found has another character. What character? I should
have thought him to be of those whose love is eager on one side only.
Did I think so, Cratippus? Well, I shall seem a madman, if—professing
the while to all to be a wolf,—you of a sudden appear in the character
of a kid).

But most important in this connection is the passage of <i>Aeschines</i>,
Orat. in Timarch., p. 178., μὴ γὰρ οἴεσθαι, ὦ Ἀθηναῖοι, τὰς τῶν
ἀτυχημάτων ἀρχὰς ἀπὸ θεῶν, ἀλλ’ οὐχ ὑπ’ ἀνθρώπων ἀσελγείας γίνεσθαι,
μηδὲ τοὺς ἠσεβηκότας, καθάπερ ἐπὶ ταῖς τραγῳδίαισι, Ποινὰς ἐλαύνειν
καὶ κολάζειν δᾳσὶν ἡμμέναις· ἀλλ’ αἱ προπετεῖς τοῦ σώματος ἡδοναὶ, καὶ
τὸ μηδὲν ἱκανὸν ἡγεῖσθαι. (For you must not dream, Athenians, that the
causes of calamities are from the gods, and that such are not rather
due to the wickedness of mankind. Do not imagine the impious are
driven by Furies, as is represented in the Tragedies, and chastised
with blazing torches; nay! it is reckless indulgence in bodily
pleasures that is the scourge, and immoderate desires). Comp. <i>Theon</i>,
Progymn., ch. 7.—<i>Cicero</i>, Orat. in Pison., 20., Nolite putare, Patres
Conscripti, ut in scena videtis homines consceleratos impulso deorum
terreri Furiarum taedis ardentibus. Sua quemque fraus, suum facinus,
suum scelus, sua audacia de sanitate ac mente deturbat. Hae sunt
impiorum Furiae, hae flammae, hae faces. (Dream not, Conscript Fathers,
that wicked men, as you see represented on the stage, are driven in
terror, at the instigation of the gods, by the blazing torches of the
Furies. ’Tis his own dishonesty, his own wickedness, his own baseness,
his own recklessness, that destroys each man’s health and sanity. These
are the furies that torment the impious, these the flames and torches).</p></div>

ἐρεθίσαι τῆς θεοῦ τὴν ἄπαυστον ταύτην ὀργήν. (for translation see text
above.) The word ἔρις—strife, in this passage is obviously corrupt,
having got into the text probably by confusion with ἐρεθίσαι—to
provoke, standing just below in the MS. <i>Jacobs</i> proposed ἔρνος—scion,
but according to <i>Lehmann</i> this is too poetical a word for <i>Lucian</i>;
ἐρεὺς—in the sense of <i>heir</i>, might very well be read, giving the
same meaning. Could ὕβριν—insolence, have been the original word in
the text? Lucian must have written the passage with a reference to
the above mentioned punishment of the Lemnian women by Venus, and
by Λημνιάδων—Lemnian women, we must understand not the descendants
of the women of Lemnos, but these women themselves, <i>Apollonius
Rhodius</i> (Argon., I. 653.) also using Λημνιάδες δὲ γυναῖκες—Lemnian
women, of these same inhabitants of the island. Now the Greeks
characterized every form of behaviour of a kind to incur the anger
of the goddess by the word ὕβρις—overbearing insolence; and this
would exactly fit in the passage, for the οὐδὲ ... οὐδὲ—neither ...
nor, calls for a correspondence of phrase in each clause, and ὕβρις
and ἀγροικία—brutal insensibility, tally excellently. For ὕβρις in
the sense indicated comp. <i>Clement of Alexandria</i>, Paedag., Bk. II.
ch. 10., ἐπιθυμία γὰρ κακὴ ὄνομα ὕβρις, καὶ τὸν τῆς ἐπιθυμίας ἵππον,
ὑβριστὴν ὁ Πλάτων (Phaedr. pp. 1226, 27.) προσεῖπεν, Ἵπποι θηλυμανεῖς
ἐγενήθητέ μοι, ἀναγνούς. (for evil concupiscence is called ὕβρις,
and the horse of concupiscence Plato named Ὑβριστὴς—Overbearing,
having read “Wild horses ye became to me.”) We should then have to
translate, supposing we read ὕβριν in the text, “I am neither puffed
up with the insolence of the women of Lemnos, nor yet with the brutal
insensibility of Hippolytus.” Very possibly an Attic writer would not
have expressed himself so; but we must remember that <i>Fr. Jacobs</i>, a
man of fine discrimination of Classical diction, denied from the first
Lucian’s authorship of the passage <i>ob orationem difficilem valdeque
impeditam</i>—because of its difficult and exceedingly awkward style. The
unfavourable judgement which <i>Lehmann</i> in his edition passes on this
Work (Lucian’s Amores) so far as its general tenor is concerned, is
based we may observe almost entirely on the confusion of paedophilia
with paederastia. However under no circumstances has any actual
allusion been made to the lewdness of the Lemnian women, if <i>Belin</i>,
<i>de Ballu</i>, and others agree in this rendering.</p></div>

Satir. II. 16. <i>W. E. Weber</i> (“Die Satiren des <i>D. J.
Juvenalis</i>.”—The Satires of Decimus Junius Juvenalis. Halle 1838.)
is mistaken in his way of taking this passage. Not only does he in
his translation assign Peribomius’ words to Juvenal himself, but
also in the notes, pp. 286 sqq., gives quite wrong explanations of
several words. For instance he says, “<i>inter Socraticos ... cinaedos</i>,
(amongst the Socratic cinaedi), the Socratic breed of wantons, the kind
that give themselves an air of sober and highly moral habits, like
Socrates;” but really the poet merely meant to express the idea of
later times that Socrates had been a paederast. Discussing the passage
Weber remarks of Peribomius, “One who in looks and gait, as being
effeminate and of a womanish dandified bearing, confesses his evil
state,—one of enervation and womanish amorousness,” whereas as a matter
of fact Peribomius makes no other confession than simply that he is a
pathic. We are not to suppose any sort of intentional suppression of
the facts, as indeed is shown both by the rest of the translation and
also expressly on p. VI of the Preface; so we are bound to characterize
what is said in these places as the result of downright mistake.</p></div>

When <i>Juvenal</i>, V. 50., says: Hippo subit iuvenes et <i>morbo</i>

a pathic, but also a Fellator (see subsequently). Further Epigr. 131.

to the light of day such as follow after Bacchus and Venus; and hearts
that wanton at feast and board, and that seek to raise the merry laugh

and becoming appearance; to curl the hair and lay it in waving ripples
or else to gather in the locks with circlets and arrange them in a
heavy top-knot, and to alter the head by adding false ringlets; to
polish the shaggy limbs with hollow pumice-stone; yea! and to hate the
very sight of a man, and long for arms without growth of hair. Women’s
robes they wear; the coverings of their feet are less for use than
show; and steps broken in to an effeminate gait are their delight.
Nature they scorn; indeed in their breast there lies a pride they
cannot avow, and they vaunt their disease (vice) under the name of
virtue. Ever to love is a little thing in their eyes; their wish will
be to be seen to love).

  <div class="verse indent2">Contaminato cum grege turpium</div>
  <div class="verse indent2"><i>Morbo</i> virorum.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>
(With her (Cleopatra’s) herd of foul men stained with disease—vice). It
is taken by <i>Stark</i> as by most of the commentators to mean <i>castrated</i>
persons, though strictly speaking it implies nothing more than a
contemptuous circumlocution for Egyptians. The boys that were kept in
the brothels at Rome for purposes of paederastia were for the most
part from Egypt, whence they were imported in flocks. Accordingly
the poet calls the whole <i>entourage</i> of Cleopatra pathics. There can
be no mistake, if only we translate thus: <i>cum contaminato grege
virorum, morbo turpium</i>, (with a polluted herd of men, defiled with
disease—vice). In this Horace was all the more justified, because as a
matter of fact Cleopatra did keep cinaedi, as we learn from <i>Suidas</i>:
s. v. κίναιδα καὶ κιναιδία· ἠ ἀναισχυντία· ἀπὸ τοῦ κινεῖν τὰ αἰδοῖα. <em class="gesperrt">Ὁ
τῆς Κλεοπάτρας κίναιδος</em> Χελιδὼν ἐκαλεῖτο. (under the words κίναιδα
and κίναιδία: shameless practice; from the moving (τὸ κινεῖν of the
genitals. <i>Cleopatra’s cinaedus</i> was called Chelidon. True <i>Terence</i>,
Eunuch. I. 2. 87., makes Phaedria say:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent2">Porro <i>eunuchum</i> dixisti velle te,</div>

<p>
(I have discovered wherefore you said you wanted a <i>eunuch</i>, because
only queens use them) and Donatus observes on the passage that
<i>reginae</i> (queens) stands for <i>feminae divites</i> (rich ladies).
Accordingly just as Eunuchus is used for cinaedus or pathicus, in the
same way cinaedus might very well stand in <i>Suidas</i> for eunuch, and
as a matter of fact the <i>entourage</i> of Cleopatra may have consisted
of actual eunuchs. Still it is Horace’s main point that they were
<i>pathics</i>. As to the reason why <i>reginae</i> (queens, rich ladies) kept
<i>castrati</i> (eunuchs) at all, comp. p. 125 above.—The Latin <i>grex</i>
(herd) is sufficiently explained by the παίδων ἀγέλας (herds of boys)
in the passages already quoted (p. 131.) from <i>Tatian</i> and <i>Justin
Martyr</i>, along side which we may put the μειρακίων ὡραίων ἀγέλαι (herds
of lads in the bloom of youth) of <i>Clement of Alexandria</i>, Paedag. bk.
III. ch. 4. The word is used in the same sense by <i>Seneca</i>, Epist 95.,
Transeo <i>puerorum infelicium greges</i>, quos post transacta convivia
aliae cubiculi contumeliae expectant. Transeo <i>agmina exoletorum</i> per
nationes coloresque descripta. (I pass over the <i>herds of unhappy
boys</i>, whom after the feast is done, other affronts of the bed-chamber
await. I pass over the <i>serried ranks of debauchees</i> (cinaedi)
marshalled by nation and complexion.) <i>Cicero</i>, Ad Atticum I. 13.,
Concursabant barbatuli iuvenes, totus ille <i>grex</i> Catilinae, (Thither
flocked the youths of the baby beards, all the <i>herd</i> of Catiline’s
friends.) <i>Petronius</i>, Sat. ch. 40., Grex agit in scena mimum. (The
common herd plays the mime on the stage.) <i>Grex</i> was used generally
for any crowd of <i>common</i> men.—The use of the word <i>contaminatus</i>
(polluted) brings to mind <i>catamitus</i>, which bears the sense of
pathic, e. g. in <i>Cicero</i>, Philipp. II. 31., <i>Appuleius</i>, Metam. I.
p. 107 and especially is used as a nickname for Ganymede. <i>Plautus</i>,
Menaechm. I. 2. 34.—<i>Festus</i>: Catamitum pro Ganymede dixerunt, qui
fuit Jovis concubinus, (Men said <i>catamitus</i> for Ganymedes, who was
Jupiter’s bed-fellow),—which probably led to the ridiculous idea
being entertained, e.g. by <i>Scheller</i>, that the word was derived from
<i>Ganymedes</i> by corruption in the pronunciation! The fact that the
word is metrically a “Paeon tertius”, that is to say the <i>i</i> in the
third syllable is long, might have led us at once to the conclusion
that originally the word was <i>catamytus</i>, and derived from the
Greek καταμύσσω (to tear), and so has the same meaning as the Latin
<i>percisus</i> (cut), or else that it stands for καταμίκτος (mixed), and
is connected with καταμίγνυμι (to mix), and so in fact <i>concubinus</i>
(sharing the bed), as Festus says! At any rate the passages quoted
above from Cicero and Seneca, which might easily be multiplied, prove
that Stark’s supposition expressed on p. 22., to the effect that
<i>morbus</i> (disease) is used in this sense <i>only</i> in the poets, is
unfounded.</p></div>

(To buy pleasure for a small coin, and not pursue secret amours,—most
base of all diseases,—for overmastering lust’s sake and not for love.)
Νόσημα (disease) is used in the same sense in <i>Lucian</i>, Amores 3.,
and πάθος (suffering, passion) in many passages in the same Work.
<i>Plutarch</i>, Amator. p. 763., καὶ λελάληκε (Μένανδρος) περὶ τοῦ πάθους

like a philosopher). The following passage in <i>Philo</i>, De specialibus
legibus,—Opera. edit. Mangey, Vol. II. p. 301., is of interest: Ἔχει
μὲν οὖν καὶ ἡ κατὰ φύσιν ἡδονὴ πολλάκις μέμψιν, ὅταν ἀμέτρως καὶ
ἀκορέστως χρῆταί τις αὐτῇ, καθάπερ οἱ ἄπληστοι περὶ ἐδωδὴν, κἂν εἰ

ἐξαναλίσκουσα ἑτέραν οὐκ εἰς μακρὰν ἐπιζητεῖ πολλὴν ἰκμάδα, ἧς τὸ

</p>
<p>
(So the gratification even of natural pleasure is often blameworthy,
when it is indulged immoderately and insatiably, just as men who are
insatiably greedy about eating are blameworthy, even though they should
not partake of any forbidden meats. So too men who are madly devoted
to intercourse with women, and go with women lewdly,—not strange women
but their own wives. <i>And the blame lies rather with the body than with
the mind in most cases, for the body has within it a great flame, which
using up the fuel cast to it, does not for long lack much moisture,
the watery humour of which is drawn off by intercourse with women,
producing ticklings and gnashings with the teeth and unappeasable
itchings.</i>) Immoderate copulation then with a man’s own wife is only
a reproach that concerns the body more than the mind; on the other
hand <i>Philo</i> in the succeeding sentences speaks of those who practise
fornication with <i>strange</i> women as, ἀνίατον νόσον ψυχῆς νοσοῦντας
(sick of an incurable sickness of the soul., <i>Clement of Alexandria</i>)

ἔλεγε σοφιστής, νόσον ἀνίατον ἡγούμενος. (the sophist of Abdera used
to speak of coition as a miniature epilepsy, deeming it an incurable
disease). <i>Gellius</i>, bk. XIX. ch. 2., indeed attributes this expression

under the influence of passion; for fits of anger and the desires of
sensual pleasures and some such things do unmistakably produce a change
in the condition of the body, and in some cases actually cause madness.
It is clear then that we must regard incontinent people as being in
much the same condition as people so affected, i.e. people asleep or
mad or intoxicated.—ch. 6., Other such states again are the results
of a morbid disposition or of habit, as e.g. the practice of plucking
out one’s hair, or biting one’s nails, or eating cinders and earth,
<i>or of committing unnatural vice</i>; for these habits are sometimes
natural,—when a person’s nature is vicious,—and sometimes acquired,
as e.g. by those who are the victims of outrage from childhood. Now
whenever nature is the cause of these habits, nobody would call people
who give way to them incontinent, any more than we should call women
incontinent for being not males, but females.—For all excess whether
of folly, cowardice, incontinence, or savagery is either brutal or
morbid.—ch. 8., for he is necessarily incapable of repentance and
is therefore incurable, as to be incapable of <i>repentance is to be
incurable</i>:—If a person gives in where people generally resist and
are capable of resisting, he deserves to be called effeminate and
luxurious; for luxury is a form of effeminacy. Such a person will
let his cloak trail in the mud to avoid the trouble of lifting it
up, etc.—if a person is mastered by things against which most people
succeed in holding out, and is impotent to struggle against them,
unless his impotence is due to hereditary constitution or to disease,
as effeminacy is hereditary in the kings of Scythia, or as a woman is
naturally weaker than a man. But the man addicted to boys would seem
to be incontinent, and is effeminate.—<i>Incontinence</i> assumes sometimes
the form of impetuosity, and at other times that of <i>weakness</i>. Some
men deliberate, but <i>their emotion</i> prevents them from abiding by the
result of their deliberation; others again do not deliberate, and are
therefore carried away <i>by their emotion</i>).

<p>
This passage has been quite misunderstood by <i>Stark</i>, loco citato
p. 27, for he has made it too refer to the νοῦσος θήλεια (feminine
disease); in this error indeed <i>Camerarius</i>, (Explic. Ethic. Aristot.
Nicomach.—Explanations of Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics—Frankfort
1578, 4to., p. 344) whom he cites, had preceded him. <i>Stark</i> says:
Excusat autor eos, qui propter naturae quandam mollitiem et levitatem
vitiorum illecebris resistere nequeant. Haec infirmitas vel ex morbo
procreata vel a sexus differente natura profecta esse potest. Quarum
rationum exempla et <i>quidem alterius</i> <em class="gesperrt">διὰ νόσον</em>, <i>Scytharum morbum</i>,
alterius διὰ φύσιν τοῦ γένους mulierum debilitatem affert. (The author
is excusing such as on account of a certain softness and lightness of
nature cannot resist the allurements of vice. This weakness may have
been either induced by disease, or have sprung from the different
nature of the sexes. Of which cases he gives two examples—<i>of the one</i>
διὰ νόσον (<i>on account of disease</i>), <i>the disease of the Scythians</i>,
of the other διὰ φύσιν τοῦ γένους (on account of congenital nature),
the relative weakness of women). But Aristotle says expressly in the
passage that the μαλακία (softness, effeminacy) of the Scythians,
as well as of a woman, was διὰ γένους (congenital),—that Scythians
equally with women are weakly by birth; while his examples of the
διὰ νόσον (on account of disease) do not come till further on. The
Scythians, he says, like women, are μαλακοί (soft), and the same is
true of the man who practises vices with boys (παιδιώδης); it is a
part of their nature, and so they are not ἀκόλαστοι (“intemperate”),
for the ἀκόλαστος is such a man as cannot owing to disease govern
himself (ἀκρασία, ἀσθενεία, διὰ τὸ πάθος—incontinence, weakness,
owing to passion). Thus the question cannot possibly be here of the
νοῦσος θήλεια (feminine disease), but merely of a weakly, effeminate
mode of life; and this is properly speaking μαλακία, while the vice
of the pathic is called μαλθακία,—but the two words were constantly
interchanged, and thus a part of the blame for the mistake may very
well lie with the transcribers. A Pathic is habitually μαλακός, but
the μαλακὸς is not necessarily also a Pathic. Hence it might very
probably be right to read, as Aspasius and other editors have actually
done, Περσῶν for Σκυθῶν (kings <i>of the Persians</i> for kings <i>of the
Scythians</i>), even though the MSS. show no variants; and indeed to
confirm this one might bring forward the trailing of the cloak (ὃς
ἕλκει τὸ ἱμάτιον—the man who trails his cloak) which is mentioned
as an example, and which was, as is well known, a fashion among the
Persians.—ch. 10., οὐ γὰρ πᾶς ὁ δι’ ἡδονήν τι πράττων οὔτ’ ἀκόλαστος
οὔτε φαῦλος οὔτ’ ἀκρατής, ἀλλ’ ὁ δι’ αἰσχράν. (For not every man that
does a thing for pleasure is “intemperate” or base or incontinent, but
he that does it for <i>disgraceful</i> pleasure).</p></div>

(The Sicilians are so predominant in vice, that Nature has ceased to
satisfy their fool lusts,—that males are debauched to <i>a feminine
passivity</i> (to suffer treatment proper to women), and men fall back for
the gratification of their concupiscence on their own sex).
</p>
<p>
<i>Seneca</i>, Epist. 95., Libidine vero ne maribus quidem cedunt, <i>pati
natae</i>. (In concupiscence they yield not even to males, <i>though born to

Nonne vehementissime admiraretur, si quisquam non gratissimum

exceedingly, if any man should fail to hold it a most excellent
privilege to have been born a man, but should rather, degrading the
gift of nature, have hasted <i>to turn himself into a woman</i>) says
<i>Rutilius Lupus</i>, De figur. sentent. bk. II. Speaking of men who use
unguents, <i>Clement of Alexandria</i>, Paedag. bk. II. ch. 8. p. 177.,
says, ἀνδρωνῖτιν ἐκθηλύνουσιν and τὰ γενικὰ ἐκθηλύνειν (they womanize
their manhood, to womanize their sex). Similarly, though with a
different reference, <i>Clearchus</i> says of the Lydians, τέλος, τὰς ψυχὰς
ἄποθηλυνθεντες ἦλλαξάντο τὸν τῶν γυναικῶν βίον. (in fine, having become
womanized in their souls, they adopted the mode of life of women).

Also the verb πασχητιάω (to indulge in passive lust) is found in

because they have brought into disrepute that excellent creature
myrrh.).</p></div>

Perhaps it is from this that Bacchus gets his secondary title of
<i>Attis</i>. <i>Clement of Alexandria</i>, Ad Gentes, p. 12, says, δι’ ἣν αἰτίαν
οὐκ ἀπεικότως τὸν Διόνυσόν τινες Ἄττιν προσαγορεύεσθαι θέλουσιν,
αἰδοίων ἐστερημένον. (For which reason some maintain, and not without
probability, that Dionysus is called Attis, as being deprived of the
genital organs). According to the Scholiast to <i>Lucian</i>, De Dea Syra,
ch. 16, Dionysus was roaming about in the search for his mother Semelé,
when he came upon Polyymnus, and the latter promised to reveal his
mother’s place of abode, if he would practise paederastia with him.
This he did, and Polyymnus accompanied him to Lerna, where Semelé
would seem to have been, and died there. Mourning the death of his
paederast, Dionysus hewed out of fig-tree wood private parts of wood,
and carried them about with him constantly in memory of Polyymnus. For
this reason Dionysus is worshipped with Phallic emblems). (λυπηθεὶς δὲ
ὸ Διόνυσος, ὅτε ὁ ἑραστὴς αὐτοῦ ἔθνησκε, αἰδοῖον ξύλινον ἐκ συκίνου
ξύλου πελεκήσας, κατεῖχεν ἀεὶ πρὸς μνήμην τοῦ Πολυύμνου· διὰ ταύτην
τὴν αἰτίαν τοῖς φαλλοῖς τιμῶσιν τὸν Διόνυσον.) The story is related
at greater length by <i>Clement of Alexandria</i>, Cohortat. ad Gentes,
p. 22; but he calls the lover Prosymnus (as does <i>Arnobius</i>, bk. V.
27. Comp. Tzetzes, in Lycophron., 213), and actually makes Bacchus
practise <i>Onania postica</i> (Masturbation by the posterior), for he
says: ἀφοσιούμενος τῷ ἐραστῇ ὁ Διόνυσος, ἐπὶ τὸ μνημεῖον ὁρμᾷ, καὶ
<em class="gesperrt">πασχητιᾷ</em>· κλάδον οὖν συκῆς, ὡς ἔτυχεν, ἐκτεμνὼν ἀνδρείου μορίου
σκευάζεται τρόπον· <em class="gesperrt">ἐφέζεταί τε τῷ κλάδῳ</em>, τὴν ὑπόχεσιν ἐκτελῶν
τῷ νεκρῷ ὑπόμνημα τοῦ πάθους τούτου μυστικὸν· φαλλοὶ κατὰ πόλεις
ἀνίστανται Διονύσῳ. (Dionysus by way of performing due service to his
lover’s memory, hastens to his tomb, and proceeds to <i>practise passive
lust</i>. So cutting down the branch of a fig-tree, he fashions it to
a semblance of a man’s member; and then he <i>mounts the branch in a
sitting posture</i>, fulfilling his promise to the dead man,—a mystic
memorial of his pathic loves. Phalli are set up in Cities in honour of
Dionysus). In Arnobius, loco citato, we read that Dionysus: Ficorum ex
arbore ramum validissimum praeferens dolat, runcinat, levigat et humani
penis fabricatur in speciem: figit super aggerem tumuli, et postica ex
parte nudatus, accedit, subdit, insidit. Lascivia deinde luxuriantis
assumpta, huc atque illuc clunes torquet et meditatur ab ligno pati,
quod iam dudum in veritate promiserat.—(Bringing with him a sturdy
branch of a fig-tree, hews, planes and smoothes it, and fashions it
into the shape of a man’s penis; then he fixes it upright on the mound
of the tomb, and stripping his posteriors, advances, mounts, and sits
down on it. Then imitating the lascivious motions of a wanton in the
act, writhes his buttocks this way and that, and imagines himself to be
receiving from the wooden member the treatment which he had long ago
promised in reality). Similarly we read in <i>Petronius</i>, Sat., Profert
Enothea <i>scorteum fascinum</i> quod ut oleo et minuto pipere atque urticae
trito circumdedit semine, paulatim coepit inserere ano meo. (Enothea
produces a <i>man’s member made of leather</i>, which first of all she
covered with oil and ground pepper and pounded nettle-seed, and then
began by degrees to push it up my anus). Now too we shall be able to
explain to our satisfaction what is the meaning of the phrase συκίνη
ἐπικουρία ἐπὶ τῶν ἀσθενῶν (<i>fig-wood</i> succour,—said of weak allies),
which is mentioned by <i>Suidas</i> under the word ὄλισβος (artificial
member), and for which in the passage quoted above <i>Aristophanes</i>
substitutes σκυτίνη ’πικουρία (<i>leathern</i> succour). On this the
Scholiast observes: σκυτίνην ἐπικουρίαν καλεῖ τὴν σκυτίνην βοήθειον,
εἴτε τὴν δερματίνην βοήθειαν, τὴν πληροῦσαν ἐπιθυμίαν ἀντὶ τῶν ἀνδρῶν·
τοῦτο δὲ ποιοῦσιν αἱ ἀκόλαστοι γυναῖκες· σκυτίνην δὲ ἐπικουρίαν λέγει,
παρὰ τὴν παροιμίαν· Συκίνη ἐπικουρία· ἐπὶ τῶν ἀσθενῶν βοηθημάτων καὶ
ἴσως ἐνταῦθα γραπτέον, συκίνη ἀντὶ τοῦ σκυτίνη. (<i>leathern succour</i>: so
Aristophanes calls the leathern help, or help of hide, the instrument
that satisfies (women’s) longings in default of men. This is a practice
that incontinent women follow. He says leathern (σκυτίνη), succour
playing on the proverb, “Fig-wood (συκίνη) succour”, said of weak
efforts at assistance. Possibly we should read συκίνη (of fig-wood)
for σκυτίνη (of leather) here. Again: <em class="gesperrt">σκυτάλαι</em>· στρογγύλα καὶ λεῖα
ξύλα.—<em class="gesperrt">σκυτάλη</em>· βακτηρία ἀκροπαχής (batons: rounded and polished
staves)—(baton: a blunt-pointed staff) in <i>Suidas</i>, and the passage in
Aristophanes, τοῦτ’ ἔστ’ ἐκεῖνο τῶν σκυτάλων, ὧν πέρδετο (this is the
particular baton that made him break wind), which <i>Suidas</i>, under the
word σκυτάλον (baton) has obviously misunderstood, just as much as the
Scholiast has. For in all these passages it is the <i>Priapus ficulnus</i>
(Priapus of fig-wood), also well-known to the Romans, that we must
understand to be intended. Apposite in this connection is Horace’s
(Sat I. 8. 1.), Olim truncus eram, inutile lignum (Once the trunk of a
fig-tree was I, a useless log,)—on which the commentators have wasted a
host of extraordinary interpretations.</p></div>

indulging in male-female loves. And how much better it were that
a woman should trespass on male wantonness than that the noble
manliness of men should be effeminated and made womanish.) <i>Clement
of Alexandria</i>, Paedag., bk. II. ch. 10., ἐντεῦθεν συμφανὲς ἡμῖν

(Hence it is manifest we ought avowedly to deprecate intercourse with
males and inordinate embraces and copulation behind and unnatural
<i>unions of men-women</i>.) A little further on the same author says, αἱ
δολεραὶ γυναῖκες καὶ <em class="gesperrt">τῶν ἀνδρῶν οἱ γυναικώδεις</em>. (deceitful women
and the <i>womanish kind</i> of men,) and speaks of θηλυδριώδης ἐπιθυμία
(effeminate lustfulness). A résumé of pretty nearly all words of
this class is given by <i>Suidas</i>, s. v. Ἄῤῥεν καὶ Ἀῤῥενικῶς. Καὶ
ἡμίανδρος καὶ ἡμιγύναιξ καὶ διγενὴς καὶ θηλυδρίας, καὶ ἑρμαφρόδιτος,
καὶ ἴθρις, οὗ ἰσχὺς τεθέρισται· καὶ ἀῤῥενωπὸς, ὁ ἀνδρόγυνος· καὶ ὁ
ἀνδρεῖος· ὁ στεῤῥὸς· λέγουσι δ’ οὕτω τὰ μὲν ἄλλα γύνιδας, ἔχοντας δέ
τι ἀνδρόμορφον. Ἱππῶναξ δὲ, ἡμίανδρον, τὸν οἷον ἡμιγύναικα· λέγεται
δὲ καὶ ἀπόκοπος, καὶ βάκηλος [βάτταλος] καὶ ἀνδρόγυνος, καὶ Γάλλος,
καὶ γύννις, καὶ Ἄττις καὶ εύνουχώδης. (under the words Ἄῤῥεν and
ἀῤῥενικῶς (masculine, masculinely): Semi-man, semi-woman, double-sexed,
womanish man, hermaphrodite, eunuch—one whose virility has been cut;
masculine-looking, the man-woman,—also the manly, the strong, man. By
such names are signified effeminate men that yet have some look of men.
Hipponax also uses in this sense semi-man, and its synonym semi-woman.
Such a one is called also castrated, eunuch (pathic), man-woman,
Gallus—eunuch-priest of Cybelé, Attis, eunuch-like.) The same holds
good of the word εὐνοῦχος (eunuch), which by no means signifies only
actual castrated eunuchs. Thus <i>Clement of Alexandria</i>, Paedagog.,
bk. III. ch. 4., says, εὐνοῦχος δὲ ἀληθὴς, οὐχ ὁ μὴ δυνάμενος, ἀλλ’ ὁ
μὴ βουλόμενος φιληδεῖν· ... εὐνοῦχοι πολλοὶ, καὶ οὗτοι μαστροποὶ τῷ
ἀξιοπίστῳ τοῦ μὴ δύνασθαι φιληδεῖν, τοῖς εἰς ἡδονὰς ἐθέλουσι ῥαθυμεῖν
ἀνυπόπτως διακονούμενοι. (But the true eunuch is not he that cannot,
but he that will not, love.... Many eunuchs, and these serving as
pandars, by reason of the certainty that they cannot love, to such as
are fain to indulge in secure pleasures without suspicion.)</p></div>

was a widespread belief amongst the Ancients that the hyaena was at
one time a male and at another a female (comp. <i>Aelian</i>, Hist. anim.,
I. 25. <i>Horapollo</i>, Hieroglyph., II. 65. <i>Ovid</i>, Metamorph., Bk. XV.
Fab. 38. <i>Tertullian</i>, De Pallio, ch. 3.). As early however as the time
of <i>Aristotle</i> it had been declared a fable by him, Hist. anim., Bk.

9. Yet the idea was still cherished at the beginning of the present

Vorgebirge der Guten Hoffnung,” (Voyage to the Cape of Good Hope).
Hamburg 1803. Pt I. Letter 6. <i>Clement of Alexandria</i>, Paedagog., bk.
II. ch. 9., tells a still more remarkable tale of the hare, καὶ τὸν

βεβίωκεν ἔτεσιν ἴσχοντα τρυπάς· ταύτῃ ἄρα τὴν κώλυσιν τῆς ἐδωδῆς τοῦ
λαγὼ, παιδεραστίας ἐμφαίνειν ἀποτροπὴν. (Moreover it is said that the
hare gets every year fresh means of voiding its excrement, having holes
corresponding to the number of years it has lived; and that for this
reason the prohibition against eating hare appears to be a dissuasion
from paederastia). This is confirmed by St. Barnabas, Epist., ch. 10.
and by <i>Pliny</i>, Hist. Nat., VIII. 55. To this fable also we must look
for an explanation of the proverbial saying δασύπους κρεῶν ἐπιθυμεῖ
(puss longs for flesh-meats), and Lepus tute es, et pulmentum quaeris?
(Are <i>you</i> a hare, and look for condiments?) in <i>Terence</i>, Eunuch.,
III. 36. Possibly too the κύων τεῦτλα οὐ τρώγει (dog does not gnaw
pot-herbs) of Diogenes has a connection with the same notion,—Diogenes

<i>Naumann</i> (Schmidt’s Jahrbuch 1837. Vol. 13. p. 100.) says:
Ἐναρέες, probably a Scythian word, calls to mind the dwarf <i>Anar</i> or
<i>Onar</i> in the old Northern Mythology,—a eunuch in a sort, but who
was nevertheless reverenced as father-in-law of Odin. (<i>J. Grimm</i>,
“Deutsche Mythologie” (German Mythology). Göttingen 1835. p. 424).
With this Hippocrates’ statement would agree, according to which these
eunuchs were regarded by their countrymen with a reverence almost as
if they had been gods.—As to this, first observe that it yet remains
to be proved that the Scythian language belongs to the Indo-Germanic
family, secondly that with Onar or Anar there is no question at all
of a <i>non-man</i> or actual <i>eunuch</i>, for Anar <i>begat a daughter on
Notta</i>. This daughter, Jördh, was wife of Odin, making Anar Odin’s
father-in-law.</p></div>

<i>Hesychius does</i> give the word ἀνάρσιοι, and explains it
by ἀνάρμοστοι πολέμιοι· ἀπὸ τοῦ μὴ συνηρμοσθῆναι τοῖς ἤθεσιν.
(incompatible foes: from their not being <i>compatible in character
and disposition</i>). Plutarch, περὶ τῆς ἐν Τιμαίῳ ψυχογονίας (On the
Generation of the Soul in Plato’s “Timaeus”) near the end says: οἱ
ποιηταὶ καλοῦσιν <em class="gesperrt">ἀναρσίους</em> τοὺς ἐχθροὺς καὶ τοὺς πολεμίους, ὡς
ἀναρμοστίαν τὴν διαφορὰν οὖσαν. (the poets call <i>incompatible</i> such
as are hostile and at enmity, the difference being irreconcileable).
<i>Zonaras</i>, Lexicon, writes: s. v. <em class="gesperrt">ἀνάρσιοι</em>· ἐχθροί· <em class="gesperrt">ἀδικοί</em>·
ἀνάρμοστοι. (under the word ἀνάρσιοι—incompatible: hostile;
<i>unjust</i>; irreconcileable). Similarly the Etymologicum Magnum; s.
v. <em class="gesperrt">ἀνάρσιοι</em>· ἀδικοὶ, ἐχθροί.—ὁ ἀνάρμοστος καὶ ἀσύμφωνος· Ὦρος ·
πολέμιος, <em class="gesperrt">ὑβριστής</em>· καὶ <em class="gesperrt">ἄναρσις</em>· νεῖκος, πόλεμος. (under the word
ἀνάρσιοι—incompatible: <i>unjust</i>, hostile,—one that is irreconcileable,
discordant. Orus (the Grammarian) gives: enemy, <i>overbearing</i> man;
also <em class="gesperrt">ἄναρσις</em>,—incompatibility: strife, war). According to this we
might very well read for ἐναρέες ἀνάρσιοι; for the Temple-robbers had
been ἄδικοι and ὑβρισταὶ (unjust, overbearing), and were further known
as pathics—whose vice was ἀδικία and ὕβρις (injustice, overbearing
violence), as we have seen again and again. Another point is that
<i>Homer</i>, Iliad XXIV. 365., Odyssey X. 459., uses the expression
ἀνάρσιοι in the sense of ὑβρισταὶ, ἄδικοι (overbearing, unjust men),
and this fact was always likely to be of weight with Herodotus, even
when he was translating a foreign word. Inasmuch as the word ἀνάρσιοι
had several meanings, he may very well have added the ἀνδρόγυνοι in the
second passage, instead of the καλοῦσι Σκύθαι (the Scythians call it),
in explanation of it.</p></div>

not women practise, such women as run into wantonness, rivalling the
men that dare such abominations? but these men ought we not rather to
call <i>batali</i> (cinaedi) and <i>womanish fellows</i>? whose voices are broken
languishingly and their dress fashioned like women’s in texture and
colour. <i>Now such-like men are clearly manifest in outward appearance
for what they are by their show, and their foot-gear, by their bearing,
and walk, and hair, and glance. For by the eyes shall a man be known</i>,

practice; for life is purer near the Ocean. Would it were possible
to shut my ears to the fact that Vice in this age prevails to such a
degree that Nature has had to yield to foul lusts, that men corrupted
even to the length of <i>suffering themselves to be treated as women</i>
are filled with lust towards their own sex; yet vice itself set some
limit to its own excesses, and the last extremity of this lewdness was
to have ruined one that might have grown into a man. But what a height
of insanity is here! Young men are chosen as mistresses, and a man <i>is
called upon to endure the treatment proper to a woman</i>.) Who can fail
to see that in this passage the words <i>feminea patientia</i>, <i>muliebris

body, but giving no thought to the soul, nor the things beneath its

We expressed an opinion above (p. 175.) that no grounds of excuse
could be found for the Pathic; but we must here modify this so far
as to admit that Aristotle imagines himself to have discovered such.
In the <i>Problemata</i>, IV. 26., he examines the question: διὰ τί ἔνιοι
ἀφροδισιαζόμενοι χαίρουσι, καὶ οἱ μὲν ἅμα δρῶντες, οἱ δ’ οὔ; (Why some
men take pleasure in being loved, and of these some in performing the
act also, but others not?), i.e. why some find a pleasure in suffering
paederastia to be practised with them (the word ἀφροδισιάζεσθαι
is found in this meaning possibly also in <i>Hippocrates</i>, edit.
Kühn, Vol. III. pp. 680 and 574., where exactly such symptoms of a
complaint are described as might serve for an explanation of the
ῥέγχειν—snorting (mentioned above), while either they exercise coition
as men concurrently, or do not. As answer we read, to follow the
translation given by <i>Th. Gaza</i>: An quod excrementis singulis locus
determinatus a natura est, in quem instituto secerni naturali debeat,
sollicitaque natura spiritus excurrens tumorem admovet, excrementumque
una extrudere solet.... His autem proxime genituram quoque in testes
et penem deferri constitutum est. <i>Quibus itaque meatus habitu suo
naturali privantur, vel quia occoecati sunt qui ad penem tendant,
quod spadonibus hisque similibus evenit</i> (οἷς δὲ οἱ πόροι μὴ κατὰ
φύσιν ἔχουσιν, ἀλλ’ ἢ διὰ τὸ ἀποτυφλωθῆναι τοὺς εἰς τὸ αἰδοῖον, οἷον
συμβαίνει τοῖς <em class="gesperrt">εὐνουχίαις</em>), vel etiam aliis de causis, his
<i>talis humor in sedem confluit</i> (εἰς τὴν ἕδραν συῤῥεῖ ἡ τοιαύτη ἰκμας),
quippe qui hac transmeare soleat, quod eius loci contractio in coeundo
et partium sedi oppositarum consumptio incidant. Qui si admodum semine
genitali abundant, <i>excrementum illud large in eum locum se colligit;
itaque</i> cum excitata cupiditas est, <i>attritum pars ea desiderat</i>, in
quam confluit excrementum. Cupiditas autem excitari tum a cibo tum
imaginatione potest. Cum enim alterutra de causa libido commota est,
spiritus eodem concurrit, et genus id excrementi confluit, quo secedere
natum est.... Quorum vera natura mollis et feminea est (οἱ δὲ φύσει
θηλυδρίαι) ita ii constant ut genitura vel nulla vel minima conveniat,
quo illorum secernitur qui praediti natura integra sunt, sed se in
partem sedis divertat; quod propterea evenit quia praeter naturae
normam constiterunt. Cum enim mares crearentur, ita degenerarunt ut
partem virilem mancam atque oblaesam habere cogerentur, ... ita enim
mulieres non viri crearentur. Ergo perverti citarique aliorsum, quam
secernendum natura voluit, necesse est. Unde fit ut insatiabiles
etiam sint modo mulierum (διὸ καὶ ἄπληστοι, ὥσπερ αἱ γυναῖκες). Humor
enim sollicitans ille exiguus est, nec quicquam se promere conatur,
refrigeraturque celeriter. <i>Quibus itaque sedem humor ex toto adiit,
ii pati tantummodo avent, quibus autem in utramque partem sese
dispertit, ii et agere et pati concupiunt</i> (καὶ ὅσοις μὲν ἐπὶ τὴν
ἕδραν, οὗτοι πάσχειν ἐπιθυμοῦσιν· ὅσοις δὲ ἐπ’ ἀμφότερα, οὗτοι καὶ δρᾶν
καὶ πάσχειν), idque eo amplius quo tandem plenius fluxerit. Sed sunt
quibus vel ex consuetudine affectus hic accidet (ἐνίοις δὲ γίνεται καὶ
ἐξ ἔθους <span class="gesperrt">τὸ πάθος</span> τοῦτο). Fit enim ut tam gestiant quam cum agunt,
usque genituram nihilo minus ita emittere valeant. Ergo agere cupiunt,
quibus haec ipsa usu evenerunt et consuetudo magis veluti in naturam
iccirco illis evadit, quibus non ante pubem sed in ea vitium patiendi
invaluit (ἐθισθῶσιν ἀφροδισιάζεσθαι), quoniam his recordatio rei,
cum desiderant, oritur; una autem cum recordatione gestiens exsultat
voluptas. Desiderant autem perinde ac <i>nati ad patiendum</i> (ὥσπερ
πεφυκότες, ἐπιθυμοῦσι πάσχειν) magna igitur parte vel ob consuetudinem
rex exsistit sed si accidat ut idem et salax et mollis sit (λάγνος ὢν
καὶ μαλακὸς) longe expeditius haec omnia evenire posse putandum est.
(Is it because for each evacuation a particular locality has been
fixed by nature, to which it must be secreted by the law of its being,
and when effort occurs the spirit issuing out causes a swelling, and
then pours out the evacuation along with it.—And similarly to these
other secretions, the semen is naturally secreted to the testicles
and private parts. <i>And accordingly in the case of those in whom the
passages are not in a natural state, either through those that lead to
the private part being blocked as is the case with eunuchs and those
similarly affected to eunuchs</i>, or through some other circumstance,
<i>this sort of humour flows to the seat</i>; for it passes that way, as is
proved by the contraction of this part in the act of coition, and the
wasting of the regions about the seat. Therefore whenever men have an
excess of lewdness, in their case <i>it collects in this quarter</i>, and
so when desire is excited, <i>that part where it accumulates desires
friction</i>. And desire may be excited either by food or mentally; for
whenever it is stirred by any circumstance, the spirit runs to that
spot, and the particular secretion flows to the particular quarter
natural to it.—But such as are womanish by nature are so constituted
that no secretion or only a little occurs in the quarter where the
secretion takes place with such as are naturally constituted, but to
this spot (the seat) instead. And the reason is they are not naturally
constituted, for being males they are yet so framed that of necessity
the manly part in them is maimed. Now maiming either destroys an organ
completely, or produces perversion and deterioration; but here it
cannot be the former; otherwise the patient would be a woman outright.
Wherefore it follows that it is perverted and deteriorated, and the
secretion of semen elsewhere directed. And for this cause they are
insatiable, like women; for the humour is small in quantity, is not
constrained to find an issue, and quickly cools. <i>And those in whom
the secretion is to the seat, these desire passive pleasure only,
but those in whom it is both to the seat and to the private parts,
these desire both active and passive love</i>; and to whichever part the
secretion is greater, the more do they desire the corresponding kind
of pleasure. Besides in some cases this occurs through habituation.
Whichever act they do, a pleasurable feeling results, and so they emit
semen correspondingly. Then they desire to do the act in which this
most occurs, and thus this becomes in preference their custom, and
a sort of second nature. Wherefore such as have been habituated to
passive love not before puberty but about the time of puberty, because
when they desire pleasure memory suggests what they must do, and on
memory follows pleasure, acquire through habituation the desire for
passive gratification <i>just as if they were born to it</i>. And if a man
happen to be lewd and effeminate to begin with, all this results all
the sooner).—In the Pathic then, according to <i>Aristotle’s</i> view, the
semen-vessels carry the semen not to the penis, but to the fundament,
and set up there the feeling of desire and sensual craving. These
are the <i>born Pathics</i> (πεφυκότες), from whom he distinguishes the
<i>seduced</i> Pathics, who indulge in the vice as the result of habituation
(ἐξ ἔθους). This is the very same view that we have already (p. 172.
Note 3.) gathered from his Ethics, and which supports in the strongest
way what we there made good as against <i>Stark</i>.</p></div>

The word κέδματα, which probably is used in several senses,
can scarcely in this case betoken anything else than varicose veins,
and is according synonymous with ἰξίαι, with which it also occurs
in connection. It is interesting to find Aristotle also pronouncing
those suffering from varicose veins incapable of generation; he writes
in Problemata, Bk. IV. 20., Διὰ τί αἱ ἰξίαι τοὺς ἔχοντας κωλύουσι
γεννᾶν, καὶ ἀνθρώπους καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ζώων ὅ, τι ἂν ἔχη; ἢ ὅτι ἡ ἰξία
γίνεται, μεταστάντος; διὸ καὶ ὠφελεῖ πρὸς τὰ μελαγχολικά. Ἔστι δὲ
καὶ ὁ ἀφροδισιασμὸς μετὰ πνεύματος ἐξόδου. Εἰ οὖν ὁδοποιεῖται ἡ ὁρμὴ
γινομένου αὐτοῦ, οὐ ποιεῖ ὁρμᾶν τὸ σπέρμα, ἀλλὰ καταψύχεται· μαραίνει
οὖν τὴν συντονίαν τοῦ αἰδοίου. (Why varicosities hinder those that have
them from begetting, both men and of other animals all that are subject
to them? is it because the varicosity arises, through a transference of
spirit; for which reason also it is of use in case of melancholia. But
the act of love also occurs in conjunction with an outburst of spirit.
If therefore the impulse is made at the time the varicosity is forming,
it suffers not the seed to make a vigorous impulse, but it is quickly
cooled; and so it wastes and destroys the tension of the private part).
On the contrary according to Problemata, 31., the lame are lecherous:
διὰ τ’ αὐτὸ δὲ καὶ οἱ ὄρνιθες <em class="gesperrt">λάγνοι</em> και οἱ <em class="gesperrt">χωλοί</em>· ἡ γὰρ τροφὴ
ἀμφοτέροις. κάτω μὲν ὀλίγη, διὰ τὴν ἀναπηρίαν τῶν σκελῶν. (And for the
same reason birds are lecherous and lame men; because in both cases the
nourishment downwards is slight, on account of the deficiency in the
legs). In connection with κέδματα we must refer to <i>Foesius</i>, Œconomia
Hippocratis, <i>Coray</i>, loco citato p. 339 sqq., and <i>Stark</i>, loco citato
Note 20., and observe that like the Latin <i>ruptura</i> and the English
<i>rupture</i> it appears to specially signify swellings due to distension
and subsequent bursting. That swellings of the groin are a result of
long-continued riding, we see also from <i>Livy</i>, Hist. bk. XLV. ch. 39.,
where <i>M. Servilius</i> says: tumorem hunc inguinum in equo dies noctesque
persedendo habeo (this swelling of the groin I have owing to sitting my
horse nights and days on end). Comp. <i>Plutarch</i>, In Aemil., Vol. II. p.

ἕλκοντα τὰ ἴσχια (they are ulcerated on the hip-joints) is found
in the text. But the meaning of both words is disputed, and by no
means fixed so far. With regard to ἰσχία—we must primarily understand
the mass of muscle at the lower exterior portion of the “os ilium”,
secondly the whole seat, and the joint-socket (cotyla) of the upper
thigh. This is the interpretation of the <i>Etymologicon Magnum</i>;
ἰσχία, ὅτι ἴσχει τοὺς καθημένους· σημαίνει δὲ ἰσχίον τὸ ὑπὸ τὴν ὀσφῦν
ὀστέον, εἰς ὃ ἔγκειται τὸ ἱερὸν ὀστοῦν, ὅπερ καὶ γλουτὸς καλεῖται, καὶ
κοτύλη, παρὰ τὴν κοιλότητα· ἢ τὸ κοῖλον τοῦ γλουτοῦ, ἐν ᾧ ἡ κοτύλη
στρέφεται.(ἰσχία,—so called because supporting (ἴσχειν) those who
sit; also ἰσχίον signifies the bone below, the loin, on which rests
the <i>os sacrum</i>, which is also called γλουτός (rump), and also κοτύλη
(joint-socket) in reference to its hollowness; or else the hollow of
the rump, in which the joint-socket turns). Similar is the explanation
of <i>Suidas</i>, <i>Hesychius</i>, <i>Zonaras</i>, the Scholiast on Homer, Iliad,
V. 305, and on Theocritus, VI. 30. The general context shows that the
meaning of “Joint-socket” is evidently to be preferred here.</p></div>

The word διαφθείρεσθαι (ruin themselves) in the text is
undoubtedly written by the author with reference to the ἀνανδρία
(unmanliness). Still it is surprising that what is here pointed out
as injurious is in the Epidem. bk. VI. edit. Kühn, Vol. III. p. 609.
recommended as salutary. The expression there is: κεδμάτων τὰς ἐν
τοῖσιν ὠσὶν ὄπισθεν φλέβας σχάζειν (in cases of varicose dilatations
to open the veins that are behind in the ears). <i>Palladius</i> in his
Commentary on this passage (edit. Dietz. Vol. II. p. 143.) declares the
whole sentence wrong, writing: <em class="gesperrt">Πᾶς οὕτος ὁ λόγος ψευδής</em>· κέδμα γάρ
ἐστι διάθεσίς τις περὶ τὴν λαγόνα, ἢ φλεγμονὴ ἢ ῥευματικὴ διάθεσις·
φησὶν οὖν ὅτι καὶ ἐπὶ ταύτῃ τῇ διαθέσει τέμνων τὰς ὄπισθεν φλέβας
ὠφελήσεις· καὶ ποία συγγένεια τῆς λαγόνος καὶ τῶν ὤτων, καὶ ταῦτα
τῶν ἐκεῖ ἀγγείων λεπτῶν ὄντων, καὶ τριχοειδῶν καὶ μηδὲν ἀξιόλογον
κενῶσαι δυναμένων; (<i>All this sentence is wrong</i>; for κέδμα is really
a certain condition of the parts about the flank, either inflammation
or rheumatic condition.) Now they say that in this condition, by cutting
the veins behind, you will do good; but what connexion is there between
the flank and the ears, and especially as the vessels there are small,
and like hairs, and not able to void any considerable quantity?).—Not
a word is said here about the practice among the Scythians; are we to
suppose <i>Palladius</i> was ignorant of the fact? Also in the “De Natura
Ossium” (Of the Nature of Bones), (edit. Kühn, I. p. 508.) we find
the operation recommended in pains of the hips, testicles, knees and
knuckles; and according to a passage in the “De Morbis” (Of Diseases),
bk. II. (edit. Kühn, bk. II. p. 223.) these veins should be seared,
until they cease to pulsate. On the other hand in the “De Genitura” (Of
Generation), (edit. Kühn, I. p. 373.) and the “De Locis in Homine” (Of
certain Localities in the Body), edit. Kühn, II. p. 106.) incapacity
for generation is represented as a consequence of blood-letting from
these vessels. We leave to others the task of drawing the necessary
conclusions in view of the unanimity of the Authors of the books named,
and merely observe further that <i>Dr. Paris</i> (Roux Journ. de Med., Vol.
XLIV. p. 355., <i>Murray</i>, Med. Pract. Bibliothek., Vol. III. p. 293.)
while giving some observations on the diseases of the Turks, relates as
following: Almost every Armenian, Greek, Jew, Turk, has a seton, and
they abuse cupping to an equal extent. For a simple head-ache, they
allow the first barber they come across to put a bandage round their
throat, in order to retain the blood, and then with a razor make sundry
cuts round about the ears, for then as much blood flows away, and
without risk, as would fill a phial.</p></div>

In the text of Froesius it stands: καὶ μᾶλλον τοῖσιν ὀλίγα
κεκτημένοισιν, <em class="gesperrt">οὐ τιμωμένοισιν ἤδη</em>, εἰ χαίρουσιν οἱ θεοὶ καὶ
θαυμαζόμενοι ὑπ’ ἀνθρώπων, κ. τ. λ. (to a greater extent those who
possess little and therefore fail to make offerings; if that is to say
the gods take pleasure in being venerated by men, etc). <i>Coray</i> has
emended this into εἰ δὴ τιμώμενοι χαίρουσι (if that is to say the gods
take pleasure in being honoured and venerated), on the grounds that
τιμᾶν and θαυμάζειν (to honour, to venerate) are frequently used in
conjunction with one another to express the veneration of the gods,
which fact he confirms by passages from <i>Euripides</i> and <i>Aristophanes</i>.
Yet this emendation can scarcely be right, even though <i>de Mercy</i>
has also adopted it. The latest editor, Prof. Petersen of Hamburg, a
professed Philologist, has undoubtedly maintained not without weighty
reasons the old reading, noting Coray’s conjecture in the notes. Indeed
neither is the old reading altogether correct, but can be easily
restored, we think, if the words, as has already been done in our
translation above, are read in the following way: οὐ τιμωμένοισιν· εἰ
δὴ χαίρουσιν οἱ θεοὶ θαυμαζόμενοι,—a way of taking it that <i>Coray</i> had
already seen to be possible, only that he preferred to read instead of
οὐ τιμωμένοισιν,—ἢ τοῖσι τιμωμένοισιν, because he does not think that
the words can refer at all to the poorer Scythians, as did <i>Cornarius</i>
before him, though he translates quite correctly: “It affected to a
greater extent poorer men, as being more negligent concerning the
worship of the gods.” <i>Foesius</i> translates: “and they do not pay
honour.” In fact Coray’s chief difficulty was as to the active meaning
of τιμωμένοισι (i.e. “paying honour”, not “being honoured”); but this
use is by no means so rare, and exactly in this sense of veneration
paid to the gods by men is found in <i>Homer</i>, Od. XIX. 280, where we
read of the Phaeacians on the occasion of Odysseus’ landing:
</p>
<p class="center">οἳ δή μιν περὶ κῆρι θεὸν ὣς τιμήσαντο.</p>

<p>
(Now they <i>honoured</i> him from their heart as if he had been a god).
The whole sense of the passage requires us to refer the words οὐ
τιμωμένοισιν to the poorer Scythians, who possess little, and therefore
can offer nothing to the gods, and also do not wish to do so, as is
clearly shown in what follows; and it is exactly for this reason that
Hippocrates says, then they ought to suffer more from the disease than
the rich, if the gods practised any system of equivalent returns.</p></div>

for translation see text above: “And this is the case ..., to resign
their manly privilege.” We have it is true translated according to
the text, yet we cannot possibly take this as being uncorrupted,
but without for the moment being in a position to offer a complete
emendation of it. The sequence of thought, if we are not altogether in
error, is this: The Scythians ride <i>continually</i>, which of its self
weakens their power of generation and desire for coition, then besides
this they wear trousers, a thing that particularly struck the Greek
because he did not use them himself. These trousers were so tight,
that the wearer could not get at the genitals with his hand; again
the genitals lay close to the body, did not hang down, could not be
set in motion; at the same time they were also protected against the
wind, so that no cooling process could take place; the idle repose
and the constantly heightened temperature in combination weakened the
genitals to such a degree that the impulse to coition was at last
totally lost. Views which entirely agree with our experience of the
present day, and indeed were by <i>Faust</i>, as is notorious, exaggerated
almost to caricature. Now if Hippocrates has expressed, as is likely
enough, these views in the words ὑπό τε τοῦ ψύχεος καὶ τοῦ κόπου (under
the influence of cold and lassitude), the text must be corrupt, and
this is what we wish to insist on. For if by the words we understand
frost and lassitude, then the first at any rate is impossible; how
could the Scythians suffer from frost, when they wore trousers! Then
the cooling process spoken of just now must be intended by ψύχος
(cold)! But if κόπος (striking, beating, so weariness, lassitude) is
understood literally, in accordance with its derivation from κόπτω (to
strike), in the sense of blows, shocks, and taken as referring to the
genitals, especially the testicles, a negative and a verb must have
been lost from the text, and this appears to us too the most probable
explanation, though at the time we cannot say what verb. The matter
would be at once decided, if we could translate: so that they could
not put the hand to the genitals, and since these were encountered
neither by the cooling wind, nor yet by the shock (against the horse’s
back or the saddle), they forgot the desire for coition and coition
itself, i.e. the genitals being neither fortified by the cold nor
yet set in motion, do not remind the Scythians of the fact that they
have such organs and must use them. The movement (κίνησις) in riding
is at any rate regarded as early as Aristotle (Probl. bk. IV. 12.)
as cause of the greater lasciviousness of those who ride. He asks:
Quare qui equitant libidinosiores evadunt? An caloris agitationisque
causa eodem afficiuntur modo, quo per coitum. Quocirca aetatis quoque
accessione membra genitalia contrectata agitataque plenius augentur,
quod igitur semper eo utuntur motu qui equitant, hinc fluentiore
corpore praeparatoque ad concumbendum evadunt. (Why those who ride come
to be more lascivious? Is it that on account of the heat and movement
they are affected in the same way as by coition? Wherefore as age also
advances, the genital organs being handled and moved more, are the
more increased in size, so therefore because those who ride use the
same movement hence they come to be of a more fluid body and one ready
prepared for sexual intercourse). In Probl. 24. he is investigating
the causes of the erection of the penis, and says διά τε τὸ βάρος
ἐπιγίνεσθαι ἐν τῷ ὄπισθεν τῶν ὄρχεων αἴρεσθαι (now it is on account
of the increase of weight in the hinder part of the testicles that it
is raised). Comp. Probl. 25. <i>Continual</i> riding naturally stimulates
the impulse, wherefore the Scythians are the first in later times to
become ἀνάνδριες (unmanly), and this sooner than other riding nations
because they wore trousers. However those who are better informed must
decide the point!—Finally that in any case ἀνανδρωθῆναι (to be made
unmanly) and not ἀνδρωθῆναι (to be made manly) must be read, any one
who considers the passage at all carefully must easily see. <i>Coray’s</i>
lucubration cannot for a moment convince us.</p></div>

against the female; then they employ them as handicraftsmen, for such
tasks as shoe-making or brassworking or other sedentary occupations.

work that is not often met with in Germany, his “Traduction des œuvres
médicales d’Hippocrate, sur le texte grec, d’après l’édition de Foes”.
(Translation of the Medical Works of Hippocrates,—from the Greek text
of Foesius’ edition.), Vol. I. Toulouse 1801. large 8vo., p. 162.,
says: “On pourroit induire d’un endroit du traité des articles, à la
fin du numéro 38 (27), que ce qu’ Hippocrate rapporte ici concernant
les Scythes, et ce qu’il a dit ci-dessus, numéro 23, au sujet des
Sarmates <i>ne lui étoit connu que par</i> une tradition dont il n’étoit pas
bien assuré,” (It might be inferred from a passage in the <i>Treatise on
Joints</i>, at the end of no. 38 (27), that what Hippocrates relates here
concerning the Scythians, and what he had said in a previous passage,
no. 23, of the Sarmatians, <i>was known to him only by a tradition, the
authenticity of which he was not well assured of</i>).</p></div>
